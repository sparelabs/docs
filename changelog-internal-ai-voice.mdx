### ðŸ’¬ Improved Alternative Trip Time Messaging

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
AI Voice now uses more natural, conversational language when proposing alternative trip times, removing references to "the service is very busy."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **AI Voice calls** - when riders request trips and alternative times are available
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Changed">
- **Before**: When proposing alternative trip times, AI Voice would say "the service is very busy" before offering alternatives, which could sound negative or discouraging.
- **Now**: _AI Voice uses friendly, straightforward language: "I have an option at [time], does this work for you?" The focus is on the solution, not the problem._
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
The old "very busy" language could make riders feel like they're imposing or that the service is overwhelmed. The new conversational approach feels more helpful and positive - you're being offered an option, not being told there's a problem. This creates a better rider experience and makes the AI agent feel more like a helpful assistant than a gatekeeper. It's especially important for maintaining a positive brand impression during high-demand periods.
