<Update label="August 7, 2025" description="Driver App v2.72">
  ## Introduction
  
  This release of the Spare Driver App introduces several key features designed to improve communication, operational awareness, and overall driver experience. Highlights include customizable Quick Replies for Driver Dispatch communication, significant enhancements to offline mode functionality and additional alerts directly in the driver app.

  ## Release Timeline
  
  - **Phased Release Date:** July 31, 2025
  - **Expected Full Release:** Thursday, August 7, 2025

  ## New Features

  ### Improved Offline Mode
  
  Drivers will now experience a more robust offline mode when Network is lost, ensuring critical functions remain available without connectivity.
  
  - Drivers can see the navigation for their next stop even after losing their connection
  - Pickup and drop-off actions can be completed while offline and will sync with Spare Operations once connectivity is restored
  
  This will be available to all customers including customers using Mapbox and Google Navigation.

  ### Customizable Quick Replies for Driver Dispatch Communication
  
  ![Quick Replies Interface](/images/changelogs/driver-quick-replies.png)
  
  This feature was built to make communication between drivers and dispatchers faster, clearer, and more efficient. By providing pre-set, one-tap responses, it minimizes the need for users, especially drivers on the road, to manually type out common messages. This improves safety and ensures that operational communication is quick and consistent.
  
  Administrators can configure these "quick replies" in Spare Operations within the **Driver-Dispatch Messaging** section. The system provides distinct configuration areas for both roles, allowing for customized message sets tailored to each user group:
  
  - **Dispatcher Quick Replies:** Administrators can create and manage a list of replies for dispatchers to use
  - **Driver Quick Replies:** Similarly, a separate list of quick replies can be configured for drivers. These appear as tappable buttons in the driver's chat interface, enabling them to respond to dispatch inquiries with a single touch
  
  *Please reach out to your Spare representative to enable this feature.*

  ### Live Alerts in Driver App

  Drivers can now receive relevant alerts on the Driver App, identical to what dispatchers see on the Watchlist, to proactively improve on-time performance and reduce delays. The following alerts can now be shown:
  
  - **Late Pull-out:** Appears when a driver is logged in but has not started navigation after the scheduled pull-out time
  - **Idle outside of Service Zone:** Triggers when a driver is idle or on a break outside of the designated service area
  - **Prolonged Stops:** Shown when a pickup or drop-off creates a downstream delay of more than five minutes
  - **Unexpected Stops:** Activates when a vehicle is stationary for over five minutes while it should be en route to a stop
  
  *Please reach out to your Spare representative to enable this feature.*

  ### Permanently Visible Info Button

  The "Info" button, which contains any additional rider details, is now always visible for upcoming stops, not just when the driver is close to the location. This allows drivers to access information whenever required.

  ## Bug Fixes & Improvements
  
  This release includes several fixes to improve app stability and performance:
  
  - Resolved an issue where logging out did not clear local storage or stop navigation
  - Fixed a bug that caused voice instructions to continue after the app was closed
  - Addressed issues where dark mode was not applying to the entire application
  - Fixed a problem preventing customers using Mapbox Navigation from loading the map
  - Corrected an issue where connecting the tablet dock/charging pin would crash the app
  - Ensured that back/close button colors update correctly and fixed the close button on the profile edit screen

  ## Break visibility on View All Stops
  
  When the Show All Stops setting is enabled, scheduled breaks now appear in the all stops view with an hourglass icon, giving drivers better visibility of their complete schedule. This helps drivers see their full manifest including break times in one consolidated view.

  ## Map visibility when idle (iOS)
  
  ![Map When Idle](/images/changelogs/driver-map-when-idle.png)
  
  A setting for viewing the map while the vehicle is idle is now enabled for iOS. The driver map can appear when the vehicle is idle, showing the vehicle's current location. This helps drivers maintain situational awareness even during downtime.
  
  *Talk to your Spare Representative if you would like this enabled for your drivers.*

  ## Key Changes
  
  This update focuses on improving the experience of drivers by addressing bugs and messaging defects:
  
  - **Bug fix for No-Show Timers:** Fixed countdown timer resetting unexpectedly when arrived at pickup

  ## Time until next pickup
  
  ![Start Driving Timer](/images/changelogs/driver-start-driving-timer.png)
  
  **Previous Behaviour:** When drivers had idle time before their next pickup, the tablet would display that they were early without making it clear when they needed to start driving.
  
  **New Behaviour:** The time until a driver needs to start driving is displayed on main screen and counts down in real time.

  ## No-Show Timer Fixes
  
  **Previous Behaviour:** When arrived at a pickup, the countdown timer for when a driver should mark a rider as a No-Show would reset unexpectedly.
  
  **New Behaviour:** Once the countdown timer has begun, it does not reset or add time.
