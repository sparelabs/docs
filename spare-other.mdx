# `LiveTraffic`

**Feature Flag Type:** Other

**Description:** Switches the Driver App to use Mapbox for driving directions, instead of the default OSRM routing engine.

**Why Enable:** Mapbox driving directions are generally considered to be of higher quality than OSRM, as they include real-time traffic data. This can lead to more accurate ETAs and better route suggestions for drivers, improving on-time performance and efficiency.

**Pre-requisites:**
- A Mapbox account and API key must be configured.

**Notes:**
- The hint warns that while Mapbox directions are generally better, they ignore OpenStreetMap (OSM) changesets, which could be a factor for services in areas with frequent road network updates.

**Pre-requisites:**
- The service must use zones.

**Notes:**
- This is primarily a UI/performance tweak for the Rider App.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.
