# `RenameAccessibilityFeatures` & `RenameAccessibilityFeaturesMBTA`

**Feature Flag Type:** Do Not Enable - Customer Specific Configuration

**Description:** These flags enable customer-specific renaming of accessibility features within the UI. `RenameAccessibilityFeatures` is a general version, while `RenameAccessibilityFeaturesMBTA` is a more specific override for the MBTA.

**Why Enable:** These are enabled to meet the specific terminology requirements of a customer. For example, a customer might refer to "Wheelchair" as "Mobility Device." These flags allow the UI to be tailored to use the customer's exact language, which can be a contractual or operational requirement.

**Pre-requisites:**
- The specific string replacements must be coded into the application.

**Notes:**
- These are UI text overrides and do not change the underlying functionality. They are hardcoded for specific customers.

# `EnableSlotCompleteInVehicleStatus`

**Feature Flag Type:** Do Not Enable - Customer Specific Configuration

**Description:** Enables a UI change in the Driver App that allows a driver to mark a slot (a pickup or dropoff) as "complete" while still "in vehicle" (i.e., before the rider has disembarked).

**Why Enable:** This was likely built to accommodate a specific workflow for a customer where the definition of "complete" is different from the standard workflow (where a dropoff is complete after the rider is out of the vehicle).

**Pre-requisites:**
- None.

**Notes:**
- This alters the standard trip lifecycle in the Driver App and should only be enabled if a customer's workflow explicitly requires it.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.
