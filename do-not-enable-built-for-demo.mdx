# `RestrictedArea`

**Feature Flag Type:** Do Not Enable - Built for Demo

**Description:** Enables the ability to define "Restricted Areas" on the map. These are polygonal zones that can be used to trigger alerts or apply special rules when a trip's pickup or dropoff location falls within them.

**Why Enable:** This feature is used to demonstrate advanced operational controls and monitoring. For example, a demo could showcase how the system can flag all trips going to a high-traffic area like an airport or a special event zone. It allows for creating alerts and filters based on geographic boundaries that are not tied to a specific service zone.

**Pre-requisites:**
- None.

**Notes:**
- This feature is also listed in the "In Development" group, indicating it is not a production-ready feature. It allows for the creation of arbitrary geographic zones for monitoring and alerting purposes.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.
