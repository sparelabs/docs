# Spare Standard - Admins & Service Planners

# `LatenessThresholdOneMinute`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Admins & Service Planners

**Description:** Changes the system's definition of an "on-time" trip. When enabled, trips that are less than one minute late are still considered to be on time.

**Why Enable:** This provides a small buffer in on-time performance calculations, which can be useful for reporting and analytics. It prevents trips that are only a few seconds late from being flagged as "late," which can provide a more realistic picture of service performance.

**Pre-requisites:**
- None.

**Notes:**
- This primarily affects how data is presented in reports and analytics dashboards.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `AutoCompleteOnlyWhenAtEndLocation`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Admins & Service Planners

**Description:** Prevents a duty from being automatically completed until the driver is physically within a 300-meter radius of their scheduled end location.

**Why Enable:** This ensures that duty completion times are more accurate. Without this flag, a duty could be marked as complete as soon as the last dropoff is finished, even if the driver is far from their end-of-duty location. This feature enforces that the driver must return to their depot or end point for the duty to be considered complete.

**Pre-requisites:**
- None.

**Notes:**
- This helps to ensure more accurate data for calculating metrics like deadhead mileage at the end of a shift.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `AllowMatchingConfiguration`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Admins & Service Planners

**Description:** Exposes advanced configuration settings ("sliders") on the fleet page in the admin panel. These settings allow for fine-tuning of the matching algorithm's parameters.

**Why Enable:** This is for advanced users who need to customize the behavior of the matching engine. It provides granular control over how the system prioritizes different factors when assigning trips to vehicles, allowing for a highly customized dispatching strategy.

**Pre-requisites:**
- A deep understanding of the matching engine's parameters is recommended before adjusting these settings.

**Notes:**
- This is an advanced feature that should be used with caution, as it can have a significant impact on the performance of the matching engine.

# `VehicleClass`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Admins & Service Planners

**Description:** Enables customized routing based on vehicle type (e.g., "Car" vs. "Bus"). This allows the routing engine to use different road network data and apply different rules (like U-turn penalties) based on the type of vehicle.

**Why Enable:** This is essential for organizations that operate a mixed fleet with different vehicle types that have different operational constraints. For example, a bus cannot make a tight U-turn like a car can. This feature ensures that the routing and travel time estimates are accurate for each specific vehicle type.

**Pre-requisites:**
- Requires the appropriate routing data (e.g., OSM maps with bus-specific information) to be loaded into the routing engine.

**Notes:**
- This allows for more realistic and accurate routing for mixed fleets.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `FareRules`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Admins & Service Planners

**Description:** Enables a dedicated user interface for creating and managing complex, rule-based fare structures. This allows for the creation of fares that can vary based on factors like time of day, rider type, or geographic zone.

**Why Enable:** This is for organizations that need more than just simple flat fares. It allows them to implement sophisticated fare policies, such as peak/off-peak pricing, discounts for seniors or students, or distance-based fares, all within a structured and manageable interface.

**Pre-requisites:**
- None.

**Notes:**
- This is a powerful tool for creating highly customized and flexible fare structures.

**Related Feature Flags:**

**Notes:**
- This feature is only available for the Stripe payment method.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `AllowBookingWithoutPaymentMethod`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Admins & Service Planners

**Description:** Allows a ride to be booked using a promo code as the payment method, even if the rider does not have another valid payment method (like a credit card) on their account.

**Why Enable:** This provides more flexibility for promotional campaigns. It allows an organization to offer a "first ride free" promotion to new riders without requiring them to first add a credit card, which can be a barrier to adoption.

**Why Enable:** This provides a cleaner and less cluttered map view for services that have a large number of overlapping or complex zones. Instead of seeing a web of individual zone boundaries, the user sees a single, clean service area.

**Pre-requisites:**
- None.

**Notes:**
- This is a UI display feature and does not change the underlying zone boundaries or logic.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `ReportTemplate`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Admins & Service Planners

**Description:** Enables a powerful feature in the Analytics section that allows users to create, save, and reuse custom templates for generating reports. Users can select the specific columns they want to include in a report and save that configuration as a template.

**Why Enable:** This is a major workflow improvement for any user who regularly runs the same reports. Instead of manually selecting the desired columns each time, they can simply select a saved template. This saves time, reduces errors, and ensures consistency in reporting.

**Pre-requisites:**

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Admins & Service Planners

**Description:** Allows an organization to define its own custom reasons for why a trip was cancelled. These custom reasons can then be selected by dispatchers or drivers when cancelling a trip.

**Why Enable:** This provides more granular and meaningful data on why trips are being cancelled. Instead of being limited to a predefined set of reasons, an organization can create reasons that are specific to their service (e.g., "Rider requested earlier trip," "Vehicle mechanical issue"). This leads to better data for operational analysis.

**Pre-requisites:**
- None.

**Notes:**
- Custom cancellation reasons can be created in the organization's settings.
