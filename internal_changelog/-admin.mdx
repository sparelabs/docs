### 🔍 Search and Quick-Access for Workflows

**What's New**  
The Workflows list page now includes a search bar to quickly find workflows by name. You can also right-click, Cmd/Ctrl+click, or middle-click any workflow to open it in a new tab for easier management.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access to view and manage workflows.
- No feature flags required.

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > System > Workflows* (the main list view).

#### What You Can Do
- Use the new search bar at the top of the page to filter the list of workflows as you type.
- Right-click a workflow row to use your browser's native context menu (e.g., "Open in new tab").
- Use standard keyboard shortcuts like Cmd+click (Mac) or Ctrl+click (Windows) to open workflows in new tabs for easier multi-tasking.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, finding a specific workflow in a long list required manual scrolling, and opening multiple workflows was cumbersome. The new search and navigation enhancements make managing workflows faster and more efficient, especially for organizations with many automated processes.
