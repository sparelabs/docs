### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Case Notes Automatically Populated by AI Voice (ENG-1387)**
  - _Resolution_: When AI Voice creates a Case, it will no longer automatically add a call transcript summary to the `Notes` field. The field will now be empty by default, allowing agents to add their own specific notes and summaries as needed.

### 📝 Streamlined Rider Creation in Resolve

**What's New**  
To simplify the workflow for agents, the rider creation form within the Resolve interface now hides custom fields and defaults contact information to "contact only" rather than being used as login credentials.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the Spare Resolve product

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- The "Add Rider" form accessed from within the *Resolve* product area.

#### What You Can Do
- When agents create a new rider in Resolve, they will see a simplified form without the custom fields section, allowing them to focus on core rider information.
- The checkboxes to "Use as login credential" for phone and email will be unchecked by default.
- Note: This change does not affect the rider creation process in other parts of the platform (like Engage). Custom fields will still appear when editing an existing rider in Resolve.

#### Why This Matters
This change streamlines the rider creation process for Resolve agents, reducing complexity and allowing them to create rider profiles more quickly and efficiently during case management.

### 🎙️ AI Voice Call Transcripts in Case Activity Feed

**What's New**  
For cases created through an AI Voice interaction, a new card now appears in the case activity feed. This card provides a call summary, an audio player for the recording, and a link to view the full, turn-by-turn conversation transcript.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LaunchAIVoice` or `EngageAIVoice` feature flag
- Requires `AiVoiceConversationView` permission

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases > [Select a case that was created by AI Voice]* (in the activity feed on the right).

#### What You Can Do
- View the new "AI Voice Call" card in the activity feed for a summary of the interaction.
- Play the call audio directly from the card.
- Click the card's title ("AI Voice Call") to open a detailed peek view containing the full conversation transcript between the rider and the AI agent.

#### Why This Matters
This gives agents full context for cases originating from AI Voice. Instead of just seeing that a case was created, they can now listen to the call and read the entire transcript to fully understand the rider's issue without leaving the case view.

### 👤 Notify Assigned User in Deadline Escalations

**What's New**  
You can now configure deadline escalation rules to automatically notify the user assigned to a case. This new "Assigned User" option ensures the right person is alerted when a deadline is approaching or has been missed.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access to configure Deadlines.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Engage > Settings > Deadlines > [Select a Deadline] > Escalation Rules* (in the "Otherwise, notify" dropdown).

#### What You Can Do
- When setting up an escalation rule for a deadline, you can now select the new **Assigned User** option from the list of potential recipients.
- If a case's deadline triggers this escalation, the system will send a notification directly to the user who is currently the assignee of that case.

#### Why This Matters
This change eliminates the need to manually specify individuals or teams in escalation rules when the goal is simply to notify the case owner. It makes deadline management more dynamic and ensures accountability by directing notifications to the person responsible for the case.

### 🪄 AI-Powered Form Builder from Documents

**What's New**  
A new "Import from Document" feature in the Form Builder lets you upload a file (e.g., PDF, PNG, JPG) and have AI automatically create form fields based on the document's content.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access and the `EngageAIScan` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Forms* or *Eligibility > Forms*. When editing a form, click the new **Import from Document** button in the form builder header.

#### What You Can Do
- Upload a document containing a form.
- The AI will analyze the document and present a list of detected fields, automatically identifying field types (Text, Toggle, Single Choice, etc.) and their options.
- Review, edit, or delete the suggested fields in the "Detected Fields" modal.
- Click "Import Fields" to add the selected fields to your form.

#### Why This Matters
Manually recreating complex paper or PDF forms in Spare can be time-consuming. This AI-powered tool drastically accelerates the process, allowing you to digitize existing forms in minutes instead of hours.

### 🔔 Notify Case Assignee on Deadline Escalations

**What's New**  
When setting up a deadline outcome in a business rule, you can now choose to notify the current case assignee dynamically. If a case is reassigned, the deadline notification will automatically go to the new assignee instead of a static list of users.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- *Note: This is a backend enhancement. The user interface to configure this option in Business Rules will be available in a future release.*

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- The UI to select "Notify Case Assignee" will be available in *System > Rules > Business Rules* when configuring a "Deadline Reached" rule outcome.

#### What You Can Do
- Configure deadline escalations to be more dynamic, ensuring the right person is always notified.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, notifications could only be sent to a fixed list of users. This change ensures that the person directly responsible for a case is always notified of escalations, improving accountability and response times even when case ownership changes.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Standardized Terminology in Rider Hub (ENG-935)**
  - _Resolution_: To ensure consistency across the platform, the term "application" has been changed to "case" within the Rider Hub interface. For example, the prompt to create a new submission now reads "Start a new case for..." instead of "Start a new application for...".

</Update>

<Update label="22 January 2026" description="1 Updates">

### 📝 Conditional Sections in Case Forms

**What's New**  
Case forms within Spare Resolve now support conditional logic, allowing you to create dynamic forms where sections or fields appear or disappear based on a user's previous answers.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `EngageBetaForms` feature flag
- Requires Admin access to configure forms

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This feature is active when an agent is creating or editing a case that uses a form configured with conditional logic.

#### What You Can Do
- **Example Scenario:** You can design a form where selecting "Yes" for a "Requires Follow-up?" question reveals a new section with fields for "Follow-up Date" and "Assigned To". If "No" is selected, that section remains hidden.
- When filling out a case, form sections will dynamically show or hide based on your inputs.
- Validation rules (like required fields) will only apply to sections that are currently visible, preventing agents from being blocked by hidden required fields.

#### Why This Matters
Static forms can be long and cluttered with fields that aren't always relevant. Conditional forms create a cleaner, more intuitive data entry experience by only showing agents what they need to see, reducing errors and saving time.

### ⚙️ Configure Fallback Case Types for Triage Assignment

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - Customer Specific Configuration' and is not yet ready for customer use. Reach out to the Product team with questions.</Warning>

**What's New**  
When configuring round-robin triage assignments in Engage, you can now specify a "Fallback Case Type". If a rider has no case history for the primary case type, the system will look at the fallback type to determine the last agent assigned, ensuring better agent rotation.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `KcmEngageRoundRobinRemovingRepeatedRiders` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Engage > Triage* (when editing a Case Type's triage rules with the "Round Robin, avoiding the user who was most recently assigned a case for this rider" assignment method)

#### What You Can Do
- A new "Fallback Case Type" dropdown now appears for this specific assignment method.
- Select a secondary case type (e.g., a "Historical Log" type used for imported cases).
- When a new case is created, the assignment logic will first check the primary type for the rider's history, and if none exists, it will then check the fallback type to avoid re-assigning to the same agent.

#### Why This Matters
When historical case data is imported, it may not align with the primary case types used for new assignments. This feature allows the triage logic to consider that historical data, preventing a rider from being assigned to the same agent back-to-back, even if their most recent case was of a different type.
</Accordion>

---
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Read-Only Access in Case Forms (ENG-840)**
  - _Resolution_: Corrected an issue where users without `WRITE_ANY_CASE_FORM` permissions could still edit fields within a case form. The form fields, submit button, and AI Scan actions are now properly disabled and hidden for read-only users, matching their permissions.

---

</Update>

<Update label="13 January 2026" description="1 Updates">

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Case Name in Deadline Breach Alerts (ENG-1167)**
  * _Resolution_: "Deadline Breached" alerts now display a more descriptive, human-readable name for the associated case. For Resolve cases, this is the display ID (e.g., `INC-001`), and for Eligibility cases, it is "Case for [Rider Name]". This provides better context in both UI and email notifications.

---

</Update>

<Update label="10 January 2026" description="1 Updates">

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Stricter Validation for Required Address Fields (ENG-1037)**
  - *Resolution*: Previously, required address fields in forms (like in Spare Resolve Cases or Appointments) could be submitted with no address details, as they contained a default country value. The system now validates that these fields contain meaningful address data, preventing blank addresses from being saved and ensuring data integrity.

### 🔧 Redesigned Filters for Custom Views

**What's New**  
The filters dropdown on pages with Custom Views (such as the Cases list) has been redesigned for a more powerful and intuitive workflow. You can now apply filters and save them directly to your current view without leaving the dropdown.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `CustomSummaryBarViews` feature flag.
- Requires Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases* (the "Filters" button and dropdown)
- This new design will appear on any list page that utilizes the Custom Views feature.

#### What You Can Do
- Open the "Filters" dropdown, which now remains open after you make selections.
- Click the new "Apply Filters" button in the dropdown footer to see results without closing the panel.
- For custom views, click the "Save to View" button to permanently save your selected filters to that view.
- Use the "Clear" button in the header to reset your selections.

#### Why This Matters
The previous filter design required you to apply filters and then separately save the view, a multi-step process. This redesigned component streamlines filter management, making it much faster to experiment with filters and update your saved custom views.

### ⏱️ Timers Removed from Resolve Cases

**What's New**  
Timer-related fields, including "Time Until Limit" and "Timer Deadline," have been removed from the user interface for all **Resolve** cases. This change simplifies the view for agents and does not affect **Eligibility** cases, which will continue to display all timer-related information as before.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the Spare Resolve product.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- The timer-related fields have been removed from the following locations for Resolve cases only:
    - Case list columns and column customization options
    - Case filters sidebar
    - Case overview and case edit forms

#### Why This Matters
Timers and deadlines are a key part of the Eligibility workflow but are not relevant for most Resolve cases. This change simplifies the interface by removing unnecessary information, allowing agents to focus on the data that matters for resolving rider issues.

### ⏱️ Deadline Events in Case Activity Feed

**What's New**  
The activity feed for a case now includes entries for the entire lifecycle of a deadline, showing when a deadline has started, been completed, or been breached. This provides a complete chronological history of all deadline-related activities alongside other case events.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access and a subscription to the Spare Resolve product.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases > [Select a case] > Activity Feed tab*

#### What You Can Do
- View new entries in the activity feed for "Deadline Started," "Deadline Completed," and "Deadline Breached" events.
- Each entry includes the name of the deadline, a timestamp, and the user or system that triggered the event.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, deadline status changes were not logged in the main activity feed, making it difficult to track the history of time-sensitive tasks. Now, all deadline events are integrated directly into the case timeline, providing agents with a clear and comprehensive audit trail of all actions and automated events.

### ⚖️ Simplified and More Reliable Duplicate Case Detection

**What's New**  
Case Intelligence now uses a more straightforward and deterministic method for identifying duplicate cases. The system now flags cases as potential duplicates if they are created within a two-hour window of each other and share at least one linked object (e.g., the same rider, request, or duty).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `CaseIntelligence` feature flag
- Requires Admin access to the Resolve module

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > (select a case) > Intelligence tab*. The "Suggested Duplicates" section is populated based on the new logic.

#### What You Can Do
- Review a more predictable and consistent list of potential duplicate cases based on clear, time-based, and object-linked criteria.

#### Why This Matters
The previous AI-based approach could sometimes produce inconsistent or hard-to-understand results. This new database-driven logic provides a faster, more reliable, and easily explainable method for identifying duplicates, helping agents merge related cases more effectively.

### 🚀 Quick Launch for Case Type Templates

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - Built for Demo' and is not yet ready for customer use. Reach out to the Product team with questions.</Warning>

**What's New**  
A new "Quick Launch" section in Resolve allows you to instantly activate pre-configured case type templates, starting with a new "Incident" template. Activating a template creates a new case type with all necessary forms and fields, which are then protected from accidental modification.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `IncidentReporting` feature flag
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Resolve

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Case Types*: A new **Case Templates** section appears at the top of the page.

#### What You Can Do

### ⏱️ Case Deadlines for SLA Management

**What's New**  
The new Deadlines feature provides a powerful, automated way to monitor and enforce Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for cases in Resolve. You can now define dynamic timers that start and stop based on case criteria (like status changes or added tags) and trigger alerts if a deadline is breached.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required
- Requires new permissions: `create:deadlineDefinition`, `read:deadlineDefinition`, `RECEIVE_DEADLINE_BREACHED_ALERT`, etc.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It

Backend infrastructure is now in place for Case Type templates, enabling the rapid creation of pre-configured case types. The first available template is for "Incident" reporting, which automatically sets up the case type, statuses, a custom form, and relevant object links.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the Spare Resolve product
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Engage/Resolve

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is currently a backend and API-level feature. Activation is performed via API, with a user interface to follow in a future release.

#### What You Can Do
- **Activate Templates via API:** Use the new `/engage/caseTypeTemplates` endpoints to list available templates and activate them.
- **Auto-Create "Incident" Case Type:** Activating the `incident` template automatically creates:
  - An "Incident" case type.
  - A linked form with fields for `Incident Datetime`, `Description`, `Severity`, and `Category`.
  - Object links to associate incidents with a `Duty` or `Request`.
- **Intelligent Re-activation:** If you activate a template for a case type that was previously created and then archived, the system will unarchive the existing case type instead of creating a duplicate.

#### Why This Matters
Setting up a new case type with all its associated forms and fields can be time-consuming. Templates streamline this process, allowing administrators to deploy standardized configurations like incident management with a single action, ensuring consistency and saving time.

- Requires Admin access. To edit another user's profile, the `Update any Admin` (`PATCH_ANY_ADMIN`) permission is required.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Team > (Select a Team Member)*
- This opens a new page with three tabs: `Activity`, `Capabilities`, and `Schedule`.

#### What You Can Do
- **Schedule Tab:** Configure a team member's standard working hours and add exceptions like "Days Off," "Hours Off," or "Extra Availability."
- **Capabilities Tab:** View a user's authorization groups and, for Spare Engage, assign the "Appointment Types" they are qualified to handle.
- **Activity Tab:** View a log of the team member's recent activities within the system.

#### Why This Matters
This provides a single, organized place to manage all aspects of a team member's availability and qualifications. This is critical for features that depend on user availability, such as appointment booking and automated case assignment.

### ⚖️ Configure Case Triage and Assignment Rules

**What's New**  
A new "Triage" configuration page allows you to define automated assignment rules for incoming cases based on their properties, streamlining your case management workflow.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access. Editing rules requires the `Create, update, or delete any Triage Definition` (`WRITE_ANY_TRIAGE_DEFINITION`) permission.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Engage > Settings > Triage*

#### What You Can Do
- For each Case Type, configure a set of rules that determine how a new case is assigned.
- Set a default assignee (a user, user group, or queue) and an assignment method (Round Robin or Load Balancing).
- Use the Rule Builder to create conditional logic. For example, "IF `Tags` contains `Complaint` AND `Priority` is `High`, THEN assign to `Escalations Queue`."
- For the Eligibility product, the rule builder is simplified to only configure the trigger, default assignee, and assignment method.

#### Why This Matters
This automates the process of routing cases to the correct team or individual, reducing manual effort and ensuring cases are handled promptly by the right people.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Read-Only Triage View Correctly Hides Controls (ENG-1082)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where users without write permissions could still see editing controls (like 'Add Rule', edit, and delete buttons) on the Triage configuration page. These controls are now correctly hidden for read-only users.
- **Archived Case Types Hidden from Triage Page (ENG-1083)**
  - _Resolution_: The Triage configuration page no longer displays rules for archived Case Types, ensuring the view only contains relevant, active configurations.

### ⚡ Bulk Actions and Grouping for Case Management

**What's New**  
You can now manage multiple cases at once with new bulk actions and organize your view with powerful grouping options. These tools streamline case management workflows, especially for teams handling high volumes of cases.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the Resolve module and permissions to update cases.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases* (on both the "All Cases" list and individual case type lists).

#### What You Can Do
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple cases using the new checkboxes and use the "Bulk Actions" button to assign, unassign, change status, or change priority for all selected cases simultaneously.
- **Group Cases**: Use the new "Group By" dropdown to organize the case list by Assignee, Status, or Priority. Each group is collapsible, making it easier to focus on specific sets of cases.

#### Why This Matters
Managing cases one by one is time-consuming. These new tools allow for efficient, large-scale updates and better organization, saving time and improving operational oversight for team leads and administrators.

### 👥 Enhanced 'Reporter' Field with User and Group Search

**What's New**  
The 'Reporter' field for cases in Resolve now supports searching for and selecting not only Riders, Drivers, and Admins, but also Authorization Groups. This enhanced search is also available when filtering the main cases list.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `Engage` and `RBAC` feature flags
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Resolve

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases > (Click 'New Case' or edit an existing case) > Reporter field*
- *Resolve > Cases > Filters > Reporter filter*

#### What You Can Do
- When creating or editing a case, search for any user or user group to assign as the reporter.
- The search input shows an icon indicating the type of result (rider, driver, admin, or group).
- When filtering the case list, select any of these types to narrow down results.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, the reporter field was limited in who could be assigned. This change provides a unified and powerful way to associate cases with any relevant person or group in the system, improving tracking and reporting accuracy.

### 📝 Include Trip History in Case Letter Templates

**What's New**  
You can now include a rider's trip history directly in case letter templates using new variables. These variables allow you to create lists of trips filtered by status (e.g., `completed`, `noShow`) and time (e.g., `lastWeek`, `lastMonth`), perfect for generating invoices or trip summaries.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with permissions for the Resolve (Engage) module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Letters > Templates > [New/Edit Template]*: The variable picker now includes new `requests` variables.

#### What You Can Do
- Build templates that automatically pull in a rider's completed trips from the last month.
- Generate letters that list all no-show incidents for a specific rider.
- Use Handlebars logic (e.g., `{{#each requests.lastMonth.completed}}`) to format trip lists into tables or summaries.

#### Why This Matters
Manually compiling trip history for invoices or communications is time-consuming. This feature automates the process by allowing you to embed dynamic, filtered trip lists directly into your letter templates, saving time and reducing errors.

### ✅ Case Management Features Now Standard

**What's New**

**Pre-requisites**

- The ability to quickly **"Peek"** at forms and letters without leaving the main view is enabled by default.
