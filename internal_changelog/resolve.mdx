### ✅ Resolve Features Now Standard for All Users

**What's New**  
Several key features in the Resolve product (formerly Engage) are now enabled by default for all organizations. This includes the modern Activity Feed in the case view, the "Peek" preview for forms and letters, and conditional logic in forms.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required (previously required `EngageActivityFeed`, `EngageCaseViewV2Peek`, and `ConditionalForms` feature flags).

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- **Activity Feed**: *Resolve > Cases > [Select a Case]* (the main content area, replacing the old "Activity Log" tab).
- **Peek Preview**: *Resolve > Cases > [Select a Case]* (hovering over form or letter entries in the Activity Feed).
- **Conditional Forms**: *Resolve > Forms > [Edit a Form]* (when adding or editing form fields, conditional display options are always available).

#### What You Can Do
- All users now have access to the enhanced Activity Feed, which provides a richer, more interactive history of a case.
- Users can quickly preview forms and letters without leaving the case view using the Peek functionality.
- Form builders can create dynamic forms with fields that appear or hide based on a user's previous answers.

#### Why This Matters
These powerful features, having been proven stable and valuable, are now part of the standard Resolve experience. This simplifies platform configuration and ensures all users have access to the latest tools for case management and data collection.
