### ⏱️ Timers Removed from Resolve Cases

**What's New**  
Timer-related fields, including "Time Until Limit" and "Timer Deadline," have been removed from the user interface for all **Resolve** cases. This change simplifies the view for agents and does not affect **Eligibility** cases, which will continue to display all timer-related information as before.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the Spare Resolve product.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- The timer-related fields have been removed from the following locations for Resolve cases only:
    - Case list columns and column customization options
    - Case filters sidebar
    - Case overview and case edit forms

#### Why This Matters
Timers and deadlines are a key part of the Eligibility workflow but are not relevant for most Resolve cases. This change simplifies the interface by removing unnecessary information, allowing agents to focus on the data that matters for resolving rider issues.

### ⏱️ Deadline Events in Case Activity Feed

**What's New**  
The activity feed for a case now includes entries for the entire lifecycle of a deadline, showing when a deadline has started, been completed, or been breached. This provides a complete chronological history of all deadline-related activities alongside other case events.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access and a subscription to the Spare Resolve product.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases > [Select a case] > Activity Feed tab*

#### What You Can Do
- View new entries in the activity feed for "Deadline Started," "Deadline Completed," and "Deadline Breached" events.
- Each entry includes the name of the deadline, a timestamp, and the user or system that triggered the event.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, deadline status changes were not logged in the main activity feed, making it difficult to track the history of time-sensitive tasks. Now, all deadline events are integrated directly into the case timeline, providing agents with a clear and comprehensive audit trail of all actions and automated events.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Corrected Permissions for Case Deadlines (INC-181)**
  - _Resolution_: Previously, users without sufficient permissions encountered an error when viewing a case in Spare Resolve because the system tried to load deadline information they were not authorized to see. We've corrected this by first checking if the user has the `LIST_ANY_DEADLINE_INSTANCE` permission before fetching the data, ensuring a smooth experience without errors.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Corrected Permissions for Case Type Templates (ENG-1191)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where users with specific row-level permissions for Case Types were incorrectly blocked from viewing the list of Case Type Templates. The system now correctly applies these permissions to show a filtered list of templates the user is authorized to see, instead of showing an access error.

### ⏱️ Manage and Track Case Deadlines in Engage

**What's New**  
You can now create, manage, and monitor deadlines for cases directly within Spare Engage. This feature introduces a dedicated settings page for defining deadline rules and integrates deadline status indicators throughout the case management interface, including the main case list and individual case detail pages.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires permissions for managing and viewing case deadlines.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- **Deadline Configuration**: *Engage > Settings > Deadlines* (new page for creating and managing deadline definitions).
- **Case List View**: *Engage > Cases* (new 'Deadline' column displaying the status of the most urgent deadline).
- **Case Detail View**: *Engage > Cases > [Select a Case]* (new timeline cards showing all applicable deadlines, their status, and time remaining).
- **Alerts**: *Top navigation bar > Alerts dropdown* (new alerts for breached deadlines).

#### What You Can Do
- Create deadline definitions with specific timeframes (e.g., "2 days to resolve").
- Define rules for when a deadline applies using conditions based on case status or rider eligibility criteria.
- See at a glance which cases have upcoming (yellow) or breached (red) deadlines in the case list.
- Hover over deadline indicators to see detailed information, such as the deadline name and due date.
- View a comprehensive history of all deadlines for a specific case within its activity feed.

#### Why This Matters
Tracking service level agreements (SLAs) or internal resolution targets was previously a manual process. This feature automates deadline tracking, providing clear visual cues to help teams prioritize work, prevent breaches, and ensure timely case resolution.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Corrected Permissions for Engage and Operations Manager Roles to Access Deadlines (ENG-1185)**
  - _Resolution_: The `Operations Manager` and `Access to Engage` default roles now include the necessary permissions to view and manage Case Deadlines, ensuring users with these roles can access the new feature as intended.
- **Prevent Errors for Case Type Templates without Permissions (ENG-1186)**
  - _Resolution_: The system now checks for the `GET_ANY_CASE_TYPE` permission before attempting to load case type templates in the Engage `Quick Launch` section. This prevents errors for users who do not have permission to view these templates.

### ⚖️ Simplified and More Reliable Duplicate Case Detection

**What's New**  
Case Intelligence now uses a more straightforward and deterministic method for identifying duplicate cases. The system now flags cases as potential duplicates if they are created within a two-hour window of each other and share at least one linked object (e.g., the same rider, request, or duty).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `CaseIntelligence` feature flag
- Requires Admin access to the Resolve module

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > (select a case) > Intelligence tab*. The "Suggested Duplicates" section is populated based on the new logic.

#### What You Can Do
- Review a more predictable and consistent list of potential duplicate cases based on clear, time-based, and object-linked criteria.

#### Why This Matters
The previous AI-based approach could sometimes produce inconsistent or hard-to-understand results. This new database-driven logic provides a faster, more reliable, and easily explainable method for identifying duplicates, helping agents merge related cases more effectively.
</Accordion>

### 🚀 Quick Launch for Case Type Templates

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - Built for Demo' and is not yet ready for customer use. Reach out to the Product team with questions.</Warning>

**What's New**  
A new "Quick Launch" section in Resolve allows you to instantly activate pre-configured case type templates, starting with a new "Incident" template. Activating a template creates a new case type with all necessary forms and fields, which are then protected from accidental modification.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `IncidentReporting` feature flag
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Resolve

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Case Types*: A new **Case Templates** section appears at the top of the page.

#### What You Can Do
- **Activate a Template**: Click "Activate" on the "Incident" template to open a setup modal. After providing a name and key, a new, fully configured case type is created.
- **Use Pre-Built Structure**: The activated case type comes with pre-built forms and object links (e.g., for Duty, Driver, Vehicle), ready for immediate use.
- **Protected Resources**: Forms, fields, and object links created from a template are locked to prevent accidental deletion or archiving. A tooltip on these items indicates they are part of a template.

#### Why This Matters
Setting up new case types for common scenarios like incident reporting can be complex and time-consuming. Case templates provide a one-click solution to deploy best-practice configurations, saving administrator time and ensuring consistency across your organization.

### ⏱️ Case Deadlines for SLA Management

**What's New**  
The new Deadlines feature provides a powerful, automated way to monitor and enforce Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for cases in Resolve. You can now define dynamic timers that start and stop based on case criteria (like status changes or added tags) and trigger alerts if a deadline is breached.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required
- Requires new permissions: `create:deadlineDefinition`, `read:deadlineDefinition`, `RECEIVE_DEADLINE_BREACHED_ALERT`, etc.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve*: A new "Deadlines" area for creating and managing deadline definitions.
- *System Settings > Roles*: New permissions related to creating, viewing, and managing deadlines.
- *System Settings > Notifications > Alert Policies*: A new `DeadlineBreached` alert type will be available.

#### What You Can Do
- **Define Deadlines**: Create "Deadline Definitions" that specify a duration and the conditions for starting and stopping a timer on a case.
- **Automate SLA Tracking**: For example, define a 1-hour deadline that starts whenever a case is tagged as "Urgent" and stops when its status is changed to "Resolved."
- **Configure Breach Alerts**: Set up alert policies to automatically notify supervisors or teams via the new `DeadlineBreached` alert type when a case's timer expires.

#### Why This Matters
This feature ensures that critical cases are addressed in a timely manner without manual tracking. It provides a formal system for enforcing SLAs, improving accountability, and generating clear data on your team's response-time performance.

### 📋 Case Type Templates for Quick Setup

**What's New**  
Backend infrastructure is now in place for Case Type templates, enabling the rapid creation of pre-configured case types. The first available template is for "Incident" reporting, which automatically sets up the case type, statuses, a custom form, and relevant object links.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the Spare Resolve product
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Engage/Resolve

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is currently a backend and API-level feature. Activation is performed via API, with a user interface to follow in a future release.

#### What You Can Do
- **Activate Templates via API:** Use the new `/engage/caseTypeTemplates` endpoints to list available templates and activate them.
- **Auto-Create "Incident" Case Type:** Activating the `incident` template automatically creates:
  - An "Incident" case type.
  - A linked form with fields for `Incident Datetime`, `Description`, `Severity`, and `Category`.
  - Object links to associate incidents with a `Duty` or `Request`.
- **Intelligent Re-activation:** If you activate a template for a case type that was previously created and then archived, the system will unarchive the existing case type instead of creating a duplicate.

#### Why This Matters
Setting up a new case type with all its associated forms and fields can be time-consuming. Templates streamline this process, allowing administrators to deploy standardized configurations like incident management with a single action, ensuring consistency and saving time.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Engage > Triage > [Case Type] > Add Rule / Edit Rule*: The value input for **Priority** and **Tags** conditions.

#### What You Can Do

### ⏱️ Auto-Refreshing Case Lists

**What's New**  
The case list pages in both Eligibility and Resolve now automatically refresh in the background. This ensures that you always see the most up-to-date case information, such as new assignments from triage rules, without needing to manually refresh the page.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Eligibility > Cases > All Cases*
- *Resolve > Cases > All Cases*

#### What You Can Do
