### 👥 Enhanced 'Reporter' Field with User and Group Search

**What's New**  
The 'Reporter' field for cases in Resolve now supports searching for and selecting not only Riders, Drivers, and Admins, but also Authorization Groups. This enhanced search is also available when filtering the main cases list.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `Engage` and `RBAC` feature flags
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Resolve

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases > (Click 'New Case' or edit an existing case) > Reporter field*
- *Resolve > Cases > Filters > Reporter filter*

#### What You Can Do
- When creating or editing a case, search for any user or user group to assign as the reporter.
- The search input shows an icon indicating the type of result (rider, driver, admin, or group).
- When filtering the case list, select any of these types to narrow down results.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, the reporter field was limited in who could be assigned. This change provides a unified and powerful way to associate cases with any relevant person or group in the system, improving tracking and reporting accuracy.

### 📝 Include Trip History in Case Letter Templates

**What's New**  
You can now include a rider's trip history directly in case letter templates using new variables. These variables allow you to create lists of trips filtered by status (e.g., `completed`, `noShow`) and time (e.g., `lastWeek`, `lastMonth`), perfect for generating invoices or trip summaries.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with permissions for the Resolve (Engage) module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Letters > Templates > [New/Edit Template]*: The variable picker now includes new `requests` variables.

#### What You Can Do
- Build templates that automatically pull in a rider's completed trips from the last month.
- Generate letters that list all no-show incidents for a specific rider.
- Use Handlebars logic (e.g., `{{#each requests.lastMonth.completed}}`) to format trip lists into tables or summaries.

#### Why This Matters
Manually compiling trip history for invoices or communications is time-consuming. This feature automates the process by allowing you to embed dynamic, filtered trip lists directly into your letter templates, saving time and reducing errors.

### ✅ Case Management Features Now Standard

**What's New**  
Several features within Resolve (the new name for Engage) are now standard for all users and no longer require a feature flag. This includes the Activity Feed, the "Peek" view for forms and letters, and Conditional Form logic.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required (previously required `EngageActivityFeed`, `EngageCaseViewV2Peek`, and `ConditionalForms` feature flags)

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases > [Select a Case]* (the **Activity Feed** is now the default view instead of the "Activity Log" tab).
- *Resolve > Forms > [Form Builder]* (conditional logic options are always available).

#### What You Can Do
- The modern **Activity Feed** is now the standard interface for viewing case history.
- The ability to quickly **"Peek"** at forms and letters without leaving the main view is enabled by default.
- **Conditional logic** in the Form Builder is now available to all, allowing you to create dynamic forms that show or hide fields based on user input.

#### Why This Matters
By making these mature features standard, we are providing a more consistent and powerful user experience for everyone using Resolve to manage cases.
