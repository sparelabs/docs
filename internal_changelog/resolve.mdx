### ✅ Case Management Features Now Standard

**What's New**  
Several features within Resolve (the new name for Engage) are now standard for all users and no longer require a feature flag. This includes the Activity Feed, the "Peek" view for forms and letters, and Conditional Form logic.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required (previously required `EngageActivityFeed`, `EngageCaseViewV2Peek`, and `ConditionalForms` feature flags)

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases > [Select a Case]* (the **Activity Feed** is now the default view instead of the "Activity Log" tab).
- *Resolve > Forms > [Form Builder]* (conditional logic options are always available).

#### What You Can Do
- The modern **Activity Feed** is now the standard interface for viewing case history.
- The ability to quickly **"Peek"** at forms and letters without leaving the main view is enabled by default.
- **Conditional logic** in the Form Builder is now available to all, allowing you to create dynamic forms that show or hide fields based on user input.

#### Why This Matters
By making these mature features standard, we are providing a more consistent and powerful user experience for everyone using Resolve to manage cases.
