### 📋 Case Type Templates for Quick Setup

**What's New**  
Backend infrastructure is now in place for Case Type templates, enabling the rapid creation of pre-configured case types. The first available template is for "Incident" reporting, which automatically sets up the case type, statuses, a custom form, and relevant object links.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the Spare Resolve product
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Engage/Resolve

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is currently a backend and API-level feature. Activation is performed via API, with a user interface to follow in a future release.

#### What You Can Do
- **Activate Templates via API:** Use the new `/engage/caseTypeTemplates` endpoints to list available templates and activate them.
- **Auto-Create "Incident" Case Type:** Activating the `incident` template automatically creates:
  - An "Incident" case type.
  - A linked form with fields for `Incident Datetime`, `Description`, `Severity`, and `Category`.
  - Object links to associate incidents with a `Duty` or `Request`.
- **Intelligent Re-activation:** If you activate a template for a case type that was previously created and then archived, the system will unarchive the existing case type instead of creating a duplicate.

#### Why This Matters
Setting up a new case type with all its associated forms and fields can be time-consuming. Templates streamline this process, allowing administrators to deploy standardized configurations like incident management with a single action, ensuring consistency and saving time.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved Case Intelligence Linking and Loading Experience (ENG-1146, ENG-1143)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where Case Intelligence could not suggest related objects (like trips or riders) to link to a case. Additionally, the loading animation has been simplified by removing the progress bar and reducing the number of status messages for a cleaner experience.

### 🔍 Case Intelligence Summary

**What's New**  
This release introduces an AI-powered summary panel on the Case view page. This panel automatically generates a concise overview of the case from its description and tags, suggests relevant actions, and provides insights into the case details.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `CaseIntelligence` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Engage > Cases > [Select a Case]* (new "Case Intelligence" panel on the right side)

#### What You Can Do
- Click the "Generate summary" button to create an AI-generated summary of the case.
- View suggested tags, priority changes, and potential duplicate cases.
- Apply suggested actions with a single click.
- Use the "Thinking" peek to see the AI's step-by-step reasoning for its suggestions.

#### Why This Matters
Manually reviewing long case histories is time-consuming. This feature uses AI to quickly synthesize case information, identify key details, and suggest next steps, helping agents resolve cases faster and more consistently.

### ☑️ Multi-Select for Priority and Tags in Triage Rules

**What's New**  
When building Triage Rules, you can now select multiple values for "Priority" and "Tags" conditions. The interface now uses a multi-select dropdown with checkboxes for these fields when using operators like "is one of" or "is none of."

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Engage > Triage > [Case Type] > Add Rule / Edit Rule*: The value input for **Priority** and **Tags** conditions.

#### What You Can Do
- **Create multi-value conditions:** For example, you can create a rule where "Priority is one of [Urgent, High]".
- **Use new operators:** The rule builder now supports multi-value operators like `is one of`, `is none of`, and `is all of`.
- **Easily select multiple items:** A new dropdown component with a checkbox list allows you to select or deselect multiple priorities or tags. The trigger button will show a count of selected items (e.g., "2 priorities selected").

#### Why This Matters
This change makes Triage Rules more powerful and flexible. Instead of creating separate rules for each priority or tag, you can now group them into a single, more efficient rule, simplifying your triage automation setup.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Missing Calendar Icon in Case Activity Log (ENG-1121)**
  - _Resolution_: Restored the missing calendar icon for appointment-related events (created, updated, cancelled) in the *Engage > Cases > [Case] > Activity* log, ensuring visual consistency with other appointment UI elements.

  - _Resolution_: Fixed a UI error that occurred in a Case's Activity Log (*Resolve > Cases > [Case] > Activity* tab) when viewing changes to form fields containing complex data, such as an address. These fields are now correctly displayed as structured data instead of causing a rendering error.

### ⏱️ Auto-Refreshing Case Lists

**What's New**  
The case list pages in both Eligibility and Resolve now automatically refresh in the background. This ensures that you always see the most up-to-date case information, such as new assignments from triage rules, without needing to manually refresh the page.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Eligibility > Cases > All Cases*
- *Resolve > Cases > All Cases*

#### What You Can Do
- Previously, if a case was assigned to you or its status changed via an automated triage rule, you had to refresh the page to see the update.
- Now, the case list and the summary counts (e.g., 'Assigned to Me', 'To Do') will update automatically every 60 seconds while the page is open and visible.

#### Why This Matters
This eliminates the need for manual page refreshes and reduces the chance of agents working on outdated information. It creates a more dynamic and real-time experience, ensuring case assignments and status changes are reflected almost immediately.

### 🗓️ Appointment Events in Case Activity Log

**What's New**  
Events for appointment creation, updates, and cancellations are now automatically displayed within the activity log of the associated case.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `EngageFeature.Appointments` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

- Click the linked appointment name in an event to navigate directly to the appointment's details.

#### Why This Matters
This provides case managers with a centralized and complete historical record of a case. Instead of navigating to separate pages, users can now track an appointment's entire lifecycle from creation to completion or cancellation directly within the case's activity feed.

### ⚖️ Configure Case Triage and Assignment Rules

**What's New**  
A new "Triage" configuration page allows you to define automated assignment rules for incoming cases based on their properties, streamlining your case management workflow.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access. Editing rules requires the `Create, update, or delete any Triage Definition` (`WRITE_ANY_TRIAGE_DEFINITION`) permission.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Engage > Settings > Triage*

#### What You Can Do
- For each Case Type, configure a set of rules that determine how a new case is assigned.
- Set a default assignee (a user, user group, or queue) and an assignment method (Round Robin or Load Balancing).
- Use the Rule Builder to create conditional logic. For example, "IF `Tags` contains `Complaint` AND `Priority` is `High`, THEN assign to `Escalations Queue`."
- For the Eligibility product, the rule builder is simplified to only configure the trigger, default assignee, and assignment method.

#### Why This Matters
This automates the process of routing cases to the correct team or individual, reducing manual effort and ensuring cases are handled promptly by the right people.
</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Read-Only Triage View Correctly Hides Controls (ENG-1082)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where users without write permissions could still see editing controls (like 'Add Rule', edit, and delete buttons) on the Triage configuration page. These controls are now correctly hidden for read-only users.
- **Archived Case Types Hidden from Triage Page (ENG-1083)**
  - _Resolution_: The Triage configuration page no longer displays rules for archived Case Types, ensuring the view only contains relevant, active configurations.

You can now manage multiple cases at once with new bulk actions and organize your view with powerful grouping options. These tools streamline case management workflows, especially for teams handling high volumes of cases.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the Resolve module and permissions to update cases.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases* (on both the "All Cases" list and individual case type lists).

#### What You Can Do

### 👥 Enhanced 'Reporter' Field with User and Group Search

**What's New**  
The 'Reporter' field for cases in Resolve now supports searching for and selecting not only Riders, Drivers, and Admins, but also Authorization Groups. This enhanced search is also available when filtering the main cases list.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `Engage` and `RBAC` feature flags
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Resolve

### 📝 Include Trip History in Case Letter Templates

**What's New**  
You can now include a rider's trip history directly in case letter templates using new variables. These variables allow you to create lists of trips filtered by status (e.g., `completed`, `noShow`) and time (e.g., `lastWeek`, `lastMonth`), perfect for generating invoices or trip summaries.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with permissions for the Resolve (Engage) module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Letters > Templates > [New/Edit Template]*: The variable picker now includes new `requests` variables.

#### What You Can Do
- Build templates that automatically pull in a rider's completed trips from the last month.
- Generate letters that list all no-show incidents for a specific rider.
- Use Handlebars logic (e.g., `{{#each requests.lastMonth.completed}}`) to format trip lists into tables or summaries.
