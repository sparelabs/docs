### 🚨 Activate and Use Incident Management Case Templates

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - Built for Demo' and is not yet ready for customer use. Reach out to the Product team with questions.</Warning>

**What's New**  
You can now activate a pre-configured "Incident" case type template from Spare Resolve. Once activated, you can link driver break reasons to this template, enabling the automatic creation of an incident report case whenever a driver reports a break for a reason like "Accident" or "Mechanical Failure".

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `IncidentReporting` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Case Types*: A new "Quick Launch" section is available for activating the "Incident" template.
- *Settings > System > Driver Break Reasons*: A new "Incident" toggle column appears in the table.
- *Operations > Duties > [select a duty] > Breaks tab*: A confirmation modal with a link to the incident case will appear after creating a break with an incident-linked reason.

#### What You Can Do
- **Activate Template**: Navigate to *Resolve > Case Types* and click "Activate" on the "Incident" template in the new "Quick Launch" section to make it available.
- **Configure Break Reasons**: Go to *Settings > Driver Break Reasons* and enable the "Incident" toggle for any interruption-type break reason. This option is only available after the Incident template has been activated.
- **Auto-Create Cases**: When a dispatcher logs a break for a driver using an incident-linked reason, an incident case is automatically created in Resolve.
- **View Case Link**: After creating the break, a confirmation modal will appear showing the new incident Case ID and a button to navigate directly to the case.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, tracking incidents reported by drivers was a manual process disconnected from other workflows. This feature streamlines incident reporting by automatically creating a formal case, ensuring that critical events are documented, tracked, and resolved consistently.

### 🗓️ Appointment Events in Case Activity Log

**What's New**  
Events for appointment creation, updates, and cancellations are now automatically displayed within the activity log of the associated case.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `EngageFeature.Appointments` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases > [Select a Case] > Activity* tab.

#### What You Can Do
- View a complete history of all appointment-related activities directly within the case timeline.
- See details for each event, including status, time, duration, assigned admin, and what changed during an update.
- Click the linked appointment name in an event to navigate directly to the appointment's details.

#### Why This Matters
This provides case managers with a centralized and complete historical record of a case. Instead of navigating to separate pages, users can now track an appointment's entire lifecycle from creation to completion or cancellation directly within the case's activity feed.

### ⚖️ Configure Case Triage and Assignment Rules

**What's New**  
A new "Triage" configuration page allows you to define automated assignment rules for incoming cases based on their properties, streamlining your case management workflow.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access. Editing rules requires the `Create, update, or delete any Triage Definition` (`WRITE_ANY_TRIAGE_DEFINITION`) permission.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Engage > Settings > Triage*

#### What You Can Do
- For each Case Type, configure a set of rules that determine how a new case is assigned.
- Set a default assignee (a user, user group, or queue) and an assignment method (Round Robin or Load Balancing).
- Use the Rule Builder to create conditional logic. For example, "IF `Tags` contains `Complaint` AND `Priority` is `High`, THEN assign to `Escalations Queue`."
- For the Eligibility product, the rule builder is simplified to only configure the trigger, default assignee, and assignment method.

#### Why This Matters
This automates the process of routing cases to the correct team or individual, reducing manual effort and ensuring cases are handled promptly by the right people.
</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Read-Only Triage View Correctly Hides Controls (ENG-1082)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where users without write permissions could still see editing controls (like 'Add Rule', edit, and delete buttons) on the Triage configuration page. These controls are now correctly hidden for read-only users.
- **Archived Case Types Hidden from Triage Page (ENG-1083)**
  - _Resolution_: The Triage configuration page no longer displays rules for archived Case Types, ensuring the view only contains relevant, active configurations.

### ⚡ Bulk Actions and Grouping for Case Management

**What's New**  
You can now manage multiple cases at once with new bulk actions and organize your view with powerful grouping options. These tools streamline case management workflows, especially for teams handling high volumes of cases.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the Resolve module and permissions to update cases.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases* (on both the "All Cases" list and individual case type lists).

#### What You Can Do
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple cases using the new checkboxes and use the "Bulk Actions" button to assign, unassign, change status, or change priority for all selected cases simultaneously.
- **Group Cases**: Use the new "Group By" dropdown to organize the case list by Assignee, Status, or Priority. Each group is collapsible, making it easier to focus on specific sets of cases.

#### Why This Matters
Managing cases one by one is time-consuming. These new tools allow for efficient, large-scale updates and better organization, saving time and improving operational oversight for team leads and administrators.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Consistent Summary Bar Styling (ENG-1036)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed a visual inconsistency where the shadow effect on summary bars (e.g., on the *Resolve* and *Eligibility* pages) was lighter than other components. The shadow has been updated to match the standard style used across the platform.

### 👥 Enhanced 'Reporter' Field with User and Group Search

**What's New**  
The 'Reporter' field for cases in Resolve now supports searching for and selecting not only Riders, Drivers, and Admins, but also Authorization Groups. This enhanced search is also available when filtering the main cases list.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `Engage` and `RBAC` feature flags
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Resolve

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases > (Click 'New Case' or edit an existing case) > Reporter field*
- *Resolve > Cases > Filters > Reporter filter*

#### What You Can Do
- When creating or editing a case, search for any user or user group to assign as the reporter.
- The search input shows an icon indicating the type of result (rider, driver, admin, or group).
- When filtering the case list, select any of these types to narrow down results.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, the reporter field was limited in who could be assigned. This change provides a unified and powerful way to associate cases with any relevant person or group in the system, improving tracking and reporting accuracy.

### 📝 Include Trip History in Case Letter Templates

**What's New**  
You can now include a rider's trip history directly in case letter templates using new variables. These variables allow you to create lists of trips filtered by status (e.g., `completed`, `noShow`) and time (e.g., `lastWeek`, `lastMonth`), perfect for generating invoices or trip summaries.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with permissions for the Resolve (Engage) module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Letters > Templates > [New/Edit Template]*: The variable picker now includes new `requests` variables.

#### What You Can Do
- Build templates that automatically pull in a rider's completed trips from the last month.
- Generate letters that list all no-show incidents for a specific rider.
- Use Handlebars logic (e.g., `{{#each requests.lastMonth.completed}}`) to format trip lists into tables or summaries.

#### Why This Matters
Manually compiling trip history for invoices or communications is time-consuming. This feature automates the process by allowing you to embed dynamic, filtered trip lists directly into your letter templates, saving time and reducing errors.

### ✅ Case Management Features Now Standard

**What's New**  
Several features within Resolve (the new name for Engage) are now standard for all users and no longer require a feature flag. This includes the Activity Feed, the "Peek" view for forms and letters, and Conditional Form logic.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required (previously required `EngageActivityFeed`, `EngageCaseViewV2Peek`, and `ConditionalForms` feature flags)

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve > Cases > [Select a Case]* (the **Activity Feed** is now the default view instead of the "Activity Log" tab).
- *Resolve > Forms > [Form Builder]* (conditional logic options are always available).

#### What You Can Do
- The modern **Activity Feed** is now the standard interface for viewing case history.
- The ability to quickly **"Peek"** at forms and letters without leaving the main view is enabled by default.
- **Conditional logic** in the Form Builder is now available to all, allowing you to create dynamic forms that show or hide fields based on user input.

#### Why This Matters
By making these mature features standard, we are providing a more consistent and powerful user experience for everyone using Resolve to manage cases.
