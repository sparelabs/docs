### 👤 See Who Overrode a Request Constraint

**What's New**  
The activity feed for a trip request now shows which user manually applied a constraint override, providing a clear audit trail for manual interventions.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `RequestActivityFeed` and `ConstraintOverrides` feature flags
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Requests > (select a request) > Activity tab*

#### What You Can Do
- When a dispatcher locks a trip to a specific duty or makes another manual override, the activity log entry for that action will now include the name of the user who performed the override.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, it was difficult to track who made manual override decisions that affected a trip's assignment. This change adds accountability and makes it easier for operations managers to understand why a specific trip was forced onto a duty against standard system rules.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Duty History Time Travel Stability**
  * _Resolution_: Implemented more robust checks to handle corrupted duty history data. Previously, certain data issues could cause the Duty Time Travel view to load indefinitely. Now, the system will display a clear error message instead of freezing. A distributed lock was also re-instated to prevent future data corruption during history snapshotting.

- **Duty Time Travel Timeline Accuracy (DR-2811)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where the timeline in Duty Time Travel did not correctly represent the time a request was associated with a duty. The system now correctly recognizes events like rematches and duty cancellations as endpoints for a duty period, ensuring the timeline is accurate.

### 📅 Enhanced 'Arrive By' Window Calculation for Recurring Trips

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
The calculation logic for pickup and drop-off windows on recurring "Arrive By" trips has been updated. The system now uses and stores windows based on the V2 calculation method when the corresponding feature flag is active, ensuring consistency when individual trips are generated.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ArriveByV2ForRecurringTrips` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Recurring Trips* when creating or editing a recurring trip. The effect is seen when the individual requests are generated by the system.

#### What You Can Do
- When creating or editing a recurring "Arrive By" trip with the feature flag enabled, the pickup and drop-off windows are calculated using the new V2 logic and stored with the recurrence definition. All subsequent trips generated from this recurrence will use these stored windows, providing more predictable and consistent trip times.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, the logic for calculating "Arrive By" windows could be inconsistent between the recurrence definition and the generated trips. This change ensures that the time windows are calculated once during setup and then reliably applied to all trips in the series, improving scheduling accuracy.
</Accordion>

---
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Favorite Location Language Consistency (RAD-1285)**
  - _Resolution_: When creating a favorite location by dropping a pin on the map, the resulting address now correctly respects the organization's default language setting. If no organization language is set, it falls back to the browser's language.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `RequestActivityFeed` feature flag
- Requires Admin access to view requests

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Requests > (select a request) > Activity Tab*

#### What You Can Do
- View a unified, paginated feed of all events related to a request's lifecycle.
- Filter events to see only those that occurred while the request was on a specific duty.
- Use the timeline view to see a high-level graphical representation of key milestones, such as creation, pickup, and drop-off windows.
- Investigate a request's history with confidence, as all associated activities, including messages and overrides, are now in one place.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, investigating a request's history required checking multiple different logs and pages. This feature gives dispatchers and operations managers a "time travel" capability to easily see a request's full lifecycle, understand why delays occurred, and audit all interactions in one place.
</Accordion>

### ⚠️ Real-Time Booking Intelligence

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
When booking a trip, a new "Booking Intelligence" section appears in the UI to flag potential issues in real-time. It can detect problems like duplicate trips, missed cancellations, or accessibility mismatches before the trip is confirmed.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `RequestMisbookingsLiveDetection` feature flag.
- Requires Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Requests > Create Request* (new "Booking Intelligence" section below the trip details)

#### What You Can Do
- View real-time warnings for potential booking errors such as:
  - **Duplicate Booking**: An identical trip already exists for the rider.
  - **Possible Missed Cancellation**: A similar trip was booked but may not have been canceled.
  - **Accessibility Mismatch**: The rider's needs don't match the vehicle's features.
- Address issues directly from warning banners using action buttons like "View Duplicate" or "Fix this".
- Use the "Fix all" button to address multiple identified issues.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, booking errors were often discovered after the fact, requiring manual correction. This change allows dispatchers to identify and resolve potential issues during the booking process, preventing errors, reducing administrative work, and improving operational efficiency.

### 📅 Store and Apply Pickup/Dropoff Windows for Recurring Trips

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
When you create or edit a recurring trip, the system now calculates and permanently stores the precise pickup and dropoff windows associated with it. This ensures that all individual trips generated from the recurrence use these pre-calculated windows, improving timing consistency, especially for Arrive By trips.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `arriveByV2ForRecurringTrips` feature flag.
- Requires Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a backend change with effects visible in *Requests > Request Recurrences*. While the new data fields are not directly displayed in the UI, their impact is seen when individual trips are created from a recurrence.

#### What You Can Do
- Create or update a recurring trip, and the system automatically calculates and saves the associated pickup/dropoff windows.
- If you modify the recurrence (e.g., change the time or location), the windows are automatically recalculated and saved.
- When an individual request is generated from this recurrence, it will now use the stored windows rather than calculating new ones.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, the time windows for each instance of a recurring trip were calculated upon creation, which could lead to inconsistencies if service settings changed over time. Storing the windows with the recurrence itself ensures all generated trips adhere to the exact timing constraints defined when the recurrence was first configured.
</Accordion>

### ⏱️ Buffer Time for Return Trip Booking

**What's New**  
A 10-minute buffer is now automatically applied when booking a return trip to prevent creating trips that overlap with the original trip's drop-off time.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Operations > Requests > (select a request) > Create Return Trip button*

#### What You Can Do
- When booking a return trip from the request details page, the earliest selectable pickup time will now be 10 minutes after the original trip's drop-off.
- If you attempt to select a time within this buffer, an error notification will appear, guiding you to choose a later time.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, return trips could be booked immediately after the original drop-off, which could lead to scheduling conflicts and impossible itineraries for riders. This buffer ensures a realistic and feasible time gap is maintained between trips.
</Accordion>

---
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Intermittent Rendering Failure in Eligibility Pop-up (DR-2769)**
  - *Resolution*: Fixed an issue where the eligibility check pop-up, accessed from *Operations > Rides*, would sometimes fail to render correctly. The component now properly handles and displays all field types.

---

</Update>

<Update label="19 January 2026" description="1 Updates">

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Corrected Request Count Calculation in Demo Mode (DR-2697)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an error in Demo Mode that occurred when booking requests. The system was sometimes using non-integer values (e.g., 32.5) for request counts, which caused the booking process to fail. Request counts are now correctly rounded to whole numbers.

---

</Update>

<Update label="16 January 2026" description="1 Updates">

### ⏱️ More Accurate Ride Duration Calculations

**What's New**  
The platform now calculates and displays ride duration more accurately by using arrival timestamps and excluding dwell time. New fields have been added to the request details to provide greater insight into trip timing.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access. No feature flags required.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Operations > Requests > [select a request] > Details tab*: The timeline summary now shows a more accurate "Ride for X min" calculation.
- *Operations > Requests > [select a request] > OTP Windows tab*: Three new fields are now visible: `Allowed Time in Vehicle`, `Direct Travel Time` (previously "Travel Duration"), and `Travel Duration Flexibility`.

#### Why This Matters
Inaccurate duration metrics could make trips seem longer than they actually were, affecting analysis of on-time performance and prolonged trips. This change provides a more precise and consistent measurement of the rider's in-vehicle experience across the platform.

### ⏱️ New 'Late Pull-in' Watchlist Alert

**What's New**  
The Live Map Watchlist can now alert dispatchers when a driver is projected to be late for their 'pull-in' (the end of their duty). The system calculates the travel time from the driver's current location to their scheduled end location to predict if they will arrive after their duty end time.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access and the `LiveMapAlerts` feature flag.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Live Map* (in the 'Watchlist' sidebar)

#### What You Can Do
- Proactively identify drivers who may run late and incur overtime.
- The alert will appear in the Watchlist, showing how late the driver is expected to be, allowing dispatchers to take action if needed.

#### Why This Matters
This provides dispatchers with greater visibility into end-of-day operations. By flagging potential late pull-ins, agencies can better manage driver hours, control overtime costs, and ensure timely vehicle return.

**What's New**  
When a driver behavior alert (e.g., Late Pullout, Unscheduled Stop) is dismissed from the Live Map watchlist, it will now remain visible in the duty details pane, but with a new "Dismissed" badge. This provides dispatchers with a complete history of driver events for the day, even after an alert has been acknowledged.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LiveMapAlerts` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Dispatch > Live Map* (select a duty with a dismissed alert, view the "Driver Behaviour" section in the duty details pane)

#### What You Can Do
- Dismiss a driver behavior alert from the Live Map watchlist.
- Observe that the alert is removed from the active watchlist.
- Select the associated duty on the map and see the alert is still listed in the duty pane, now with a "Dismissed" badge.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, dismissing an alert removed it from all views, erasing valuable operational context. This change ensures that dispatchers can see a full log of a driver's behavior throughout their duty, even after alerts are acknowledged, leading to more informed decision-making and better record-keeping.

- The event details will show each changed field with its "Previous Value" and "Current Value," including changes to custom fields.

#### Why This Matters
It was previously difficult to track the history of changes made to a duty. This feature provides a clear, auditable log of all modifications, making it easy for dispatchers and managers to understand how a duty evolved over its lifecycle.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Duplicate 'Request Cancelled' Entries in Duty Activity Feed (MOT-2030)**
  - _Resolution_: Corrected an issue that caused duplicate entries for cancelled requests to appear in the *Launch > Duties > [Duty] > Activity* tab. The feed now shows a single, more informative entry and displays data with improved real-time freshness.

- **Service V2 Configuration Page Fixes (MOT-2552)**
  - _Resolution_: Resolved two issues on the Service V2 configuration page (*Admin > Services*). Slider input fields (e.g., for detour multipliers) now correctly handle increments and manual typing, and editing stop coordinates now saves as expected.

- **Missing Result Modal After Adding First Duty Interruption (MOT-2519)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed a bug where the success/failure result modal would not appear after adding the very first interruption (break) to a duty that previously had none. The result modal now displays correctly in all scenarios when adding breaks via the *Launch > Duties > [Duty] > Itinerary* tab.

### 📜 Enhanced Duty Activity Feed with Infinite Scroll

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
The 'Activity' tab for a duty has been significantly upgraded. It now features infinite scroll to seamlessly load historical events and includes rider names (with links) on relevant request events, providing more context at a glance.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `DutyActivityFeed` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Operations > Duties > [Select a Duty] > Activity tab*

#### What You Can Do

- View the rider's name directly on request-related events (like 'Request Dropped Off'). Clicking the name navigates you to the request details page.
- Add comments to the duty, which now appear interleaved with system-generated activity events.

#### Why This Matters
The previous activity feed was paginated and lacked key contextual information. The new feed provides a faster, more fluid way to review a duty's entire history and makes it easier to investigate specific trip events by linking directly to associated riders and requests.

### 🚑 Emergency "Drop Off ASAP" Action

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
Dispatchers can now prioritize an immediate drop-off for an on-board rider experiencing an urgent situation. This action moves the rider's drop-off to the next stop in the vehicle's manifest, overriding the previously optimized schedule.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `dropoffAsap` feature flag and the `Request > Dropoff ASAP` permission. 

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Live Requests* > (select an in-transit request) > 'Actions' dropdown menu.

#### What You Can Do
- For a rider who is currently on board, select the "Drop Off ASAP" action from the request's action menu.
- After confirming, the vehicle's manifest is immediately reordered to make that rider's drop-off the very next stop.
- The action is automatically logged in both the Request and Duty activity logs for auditing purposes.

#### Why This Matters
In situations requiring a rider to be dropped off urgently, dispatchers previously had to manually edit the manifest, which was time-consuming and error-prone. This feature provides a dedicated, one-click solution to re-prioritize a trip, ensuring a swift response during critical events.
</Accordion>

### 🔍 Filter by Multiple Cancellation Reasons in Workflows

**What's New**  
The Workflows module can now filter requests by multiple cancellation reasons at once. This allows for more complex and precise automation based on why a trip was cancelled.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Workflows > (when configuring a trigger or action that uses the 'Get Requests' step)*

#### What You Can Do
- Use a pipe-separated list (e.g., `noShow|lateDriver|other`) in the `requestCancellationReason` query parameter within a workflow step to fetch requests that match any of the specified reasons.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, workflows could only filter by a single cancellation reason, limiting automation possibilities. This change enables the creation of more sophisticated workflows that can handle different cancellation scenarios in a single rule.
</Accordion>

### ⏱️ More Accurate Estimates for Third-Party Fleets During Rematch

**What's New**  
The system now distinguishes between real-time and "idealized" trip estimates from third-party fleets. When using the override modal to rematch a trip, only estimates based on actual fleet availability are shown, preventing bookings with fleets that may not have a vehicle available.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Live Requests > (select any request) > 'Rematch' button > Overrides modal*

#### What You Can Do
- When you use the rematch override modal, the list of available services will now exclude third-party fleets that provide only idealized estimates (estimates not based on real-time vehicle availability). Regular booking is unaffected.

#### Why This Matters
This prevents dispatchers from attempting to book a trip with a third-party fleet that appears available but has no real vehicles to serve the trip, reducing failed bookings and improving the reliability of the rematch tool.
</Accordion>

---
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved Screen Reader Accessibility for Maps (MOT-2352)**
  - _Resolution_: All interactive maps and their controls (e.g., zoom buttons, vehicle markers, route lines) are now hidden from screen readers. This provides a cleaner, more navigable experience for users of assistive technologies by focusing on data tables and lists rather than non-navigable visual map elements.

#### What You Can Do
- Quickly assess the size of a trip group by viewing the request count in the table.
- Get more accurate, direction-specific information about a request's trip group from the Shift Scheduling view.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, it was difficult to quickly see how many requests were part of a trip group or to distinguish between inbound/outbound groups for a single request. This update provides clear, at-a-glance request counts and more precise tooltip information, making it easier for dispatchers and planners to manage recurring trips.
</Accordion>
