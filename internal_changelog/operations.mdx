### 🗺️ Duties Tab in Live Map Watchlist

**What's New**  
A "Duties" tab is now available in the Watchlist pane on the Live Map. This allows dispatchers and operations staff to "pin" and continuously monitor specific duties, similar to how they can already watch riders and requests.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required (previously required `WatchlistDutiesTab` feature flag)

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Live Map* (a new "Duties" tab within the "Watchlist" side pane)

#### What You Can Do
- Add duties to the watchlist to keep them persistently visible in the side pane.
- Quickly access and monitor the progress of key duties without having to search for them repeatedly on the map.

#### Why This Matters
During busy periods, it can be difficult to keep track of high-priority duties. This feature allows you to create a focused list of duties to monitor, improving oversight and enabling quicker responses to operational events.

### 🔍 No-Show Filter on Live Map

**What's New**  
The filter bar on the Live Map now includes a "No-show" option. This allows you to toggle the visibility of riders who have been marked as a no-show for their trip.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required (previously required `LiveMapNoShowFilter` feature flag)

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Live Map* (a new "No-show" toggle in the filter bar at the top of the map)

#### What You Can Do
- Hide all no-show requests from the map to reduce clutter.
- Show no-show requests to review their locations or other details.

#### Why This Matters
This filter helps dispatchers declutter their map view by hiding completed no-show incidents. This allows them to focus more effectively on active and upcoming trips that require their attention.

### 📝 Cancellation Reasons for Duties

**What's New**  
When cancelling a duty, you are now prompted to select a reason for the cancellation from a configurable list. This standardizes the data captured for operational analysis.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required (previously required `DutyCancellationReasons` feature flag)

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- A new modal window will appear after initiating a duty cancellation from locations such as the Live Map or the Duty Schedule page.

#### What You Can Do
- Select a predefined reason when you cancel a single duty or multiple duties in bulk.
- Ensure that every duty cancellation has a corresponding reason logged in the system.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, the reasons for duty cancellations were not systematically tracked, making it difficult to analyze operational patterns. Capturing this data provides valuable insights into why duties are cancelled, helping to identify trends and areas for improvement in driver scheduling and resource planning.

### 📊 View Requests on Duty Schedules

**What's New**  
The Duty Schedule page now includes a "Show Requests" toggle. When enabled, it displays the individual requests assigned to each duty block directly on the timeline, offering a more detailed view of driver assignments.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required (previously required `DutySchedulePlusPlusDetails` feature flag)

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Launch > Duty Schedule* (a new "Show Requests" toggle switch in the view options)

#### What You Can Do
- Toggle the visibility of individual trip requests within their assigned duty blocks on the schedule timeline.
- Get a granular, at-a-glance understanding of how trips are distributed across duties for the day.

#### Why This Matters
This feature provides a more comprehensive view of driver workloads directly on the schedule. It allows schedulers and dispatchers to easily visualize trip assignments without needing to navigate to different pages, streamlining the process of reviewing and adjusting daily plans.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Recurring Request Count Correction (MOT-2643)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where the `Recurring Request Count` column in the *Rides > Recurring Trips > Recurring Trip Group* tab was displaying an incorrect total. The column now accurately reflects the number of request recurrences associated with the trip group.

- **Correct Trip Group Display on Request Details (MOT-2383)**
  * _Resolution_: Corrected an issue where the Request Detail page would display trip groups for both directions (e.g., inbound and outbound) of a recurring trip. The page now correctly shows only the specific trip group that the individual request belongs to.

### 📅 View Recurring Trip Group Details from Duty Schedule

**What's New**  
When viewing the *Shift Scheduling* page, you can now click on a "Recurring Trip Groups" entry to open a modal window. This new view provides detailed information about all trips within that group, including which riders are on the current duty and which are assigned to other duties.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `recurringTrip`, `tripGroup`, and `dutySchedulePlusPlus` feature flags
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Launch > Shift Scheduling* (the clickable "X Recurring Trip Groups" line item within a duty's schedule)

#### What You Can Do
- Click the trip group summary line to open a detailed modal.
- View all associated trip groups, each displayed in its own card.
- See a list of riders assigned to the current duty for that group.
- See a list of riders assigned to other duties, with a link to view that specific duty.
- Navigate directly to the Trip Group details page or an individual rider's request.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, understanding the full context of a recurring trip group from the schedule was difficult, requiring navigation to multiple pages. This modal provides a quick, consolidated view of all related requests and their assignments, improving visibility and making schedule adjustments easier.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Recommended Trip Time Honored During Booking (MOT-2632)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue in the "Create Request" form where, after viewing alternative booking times under "More Options," re-selecting the original "Recommended" time would incorrectly book the trip using the alternative time. The system now correctly uses the explicitly selected option.

### 🚑 Emergency "Drop Off ASAP" Action

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
Dispatchers can now prioritize an immediate drop-off for an on-board rider experiencing an urgent situation. This action moves the rider's drop-off to the next stop in the vehicle's manifest, overriding the previously optimized schedule.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `dropoffAsap` feature flag and the `Request > Dropoff ASAP` permission. 

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Live Requests* > (select an in-transit request) > 'Actions' dropdown menu.

#### What You Can Do
- For a rider who is currently on board, select the "Drop Off ASAP" action from the request's action menu.
- After confirming, the vehicle's manifest is immediately reordered to make that rider's drop-off the very next stop.
- The action is automatically logged in both the Request and Duty activity logs for auditing purposes.

#### Why This Matters
In situations requiring a rider to be dropped off urgently, dispatchers previously had to manually edit the manifest, which was time-consuming and error-prone. This feature provides a dedicated, one-click solution to re-prioritize a trip, ensuring a swift response during critical events.
</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved RPRH Metric Accuracy (MOT-2551)**
  - _Resolution_: The Revenue Per Revenue Hour (RPRH) calculation for active duties now uses projected trip completion times instead of the current time. This provides a more stable and accurate RPRH value that doesn't fluctuate as the day progresses.

### 🔍 Filter by Multiple Cancellation Reasons in Workflows

**What's New**  
The Workflows module can now filter requests by multiple cancellation reasons at once. This allows for more complex and precise automation based on why a trip was cancelled.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Workflows > (when configuring a trigger or action that uses the 'Get Requests' step)*

#### What You Can Do
- Use a pipe-separated list (e.g., `noShow|lateDriver|other`) in the `requestCancellationReason` query parameter within a workflow step to fetch requests that match any of the specified reasons.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, workflows could only filter by a single cancellation reason, limiting automation possibilities. This change enables the creation of more sophisticated workflows that can handle different cancellation scenarios in a single rule.

### ⏱️ More Accurate Estimates for Third-Party Fleets During Rematch

**What's New**  
The system now distinguishes between real-time and "idealized" trip estimates from third-party fleets. When using the override modal to rematch a trip, only estimates based on actual fleet availability are shown, preventing bookings with fleets that may not have a vehicle available.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Live Requests > (select any request) > 'Rematch' button > Overrides modal*

#### What You Can Do
- When you use the rematch override modal, the list of available services will now exclude third-party fleets that provide only idealized estimates (estimates not based on real-time vehicle availability). Regular booking is unaffected.

#### Why This Matters
This prevents dispatchers from attempting to book a trip with a third-party fleet that appears available but has no real vehicles to serve the trip, reducing failed bookings and improving the reliability of the rematch tool.
</Accordion>

---
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved Screen Reader Accessibility for Maps (MOT-2352)**
  - _Resolution_: All interactive maps and their controls (e.g., zoom buttons, vehicle markers, route lines) are now hidden from screen readers. This provides a cleaner, more navigable experience for users of assistive technologies by focusing on data tables and lists rather than non-navigable visual map elements.

### 📊 Improved Visibility for Recurring Trip Groups

**What's New**  
We've enhanced how Recurring Trip Groups are displayed. You can now see the total number of requests associated with a trip group directly in the list view, and tooltips for requests in the *Shift Scheduling* view now show more accurate daily counts.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires the `tripGroup` feature flag.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Recurring Trips > [Select a recurring trip] > Recurring Trip Groups tab*: A new **Recurring Requests** column now shows the total count of requests in each group.
- *Launch > Shift Scheduling*: When you hover over a request that is part of a recurring trip, the tooltip now shows a daily request count and only displays the relevant trip group (e.g., inbound or outbound) instead of both.

#### What You Can Do
- Quickly assess the size of a trip group by viewing the request count in the table.
- Get more accurate, direction-specific information about a request's trip group from the Shift Scheduling view.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, it was difficult to quickly see how many requests were part of a trip group or to distinguish between inbound/outbound groups for a single request. This update provides clear, at-a-glance request counts and more precise tooltip information, making it easier for dispatchers and planners to manage recurring trips.
</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Live Requests Date Filtering (BUG-1043)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an "Internal Server Error" that occurred on the *Rides > Live Requests* page when filtering for a date entirely in the future. The page now correctly handles future date ranges without errors.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Driver/Dispatch Communications Stability (BUS-4356)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed a regression that caused the Driver/Dispatch communication feature to fail for some organizations. The system now correctly falls back to the appropriate credentials, restoring communication functionality.
