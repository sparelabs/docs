### 🔍 Filter by Multiple Cancellation Reasons in Workflows

**What's New**  
The Workflows module can now filter requests by multiple cancellation reasons at once. This allows for more complex and precise automation based on why a trip was cancelled.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Workflows > (when configuring a trigger or action that uses the 'Get Requests' step)*

#### What You Can Do
- Use a pipe-separated list (e.g., `noShow|lateDriver|other`) in the `requestCancellationReason` query parameter within a workflow step to fetch requests that match any of the specified reasons.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, workflows could only filter by a single cancellation reason, limiting automation possibilities. This change enables the creation of more sophisticated workflows that can handle different cancellation scenarios in a single rule.

### ⏱️ More Accurate Estimates for Third-Party Fleets During Rematch

**What's New**  
The system now distinguishes between real-time and "idealized" trip estimates from third-party fleets. When using the override modal to rematch a trip, only estimates based on actual fleet availability are shown, preventing bookings with fleets that may not have a vehicle available.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Live Requests > (select any request) > 'Rematch' button > Overrides modal*

#### What You Can Do
- When you use the rematch override modal, the list of available services will now exclude third-party fleets that provide only idealized estimates (estimates not based on real-time vehicle availability). Regular booking is unaffected.

#### Why This Matters
This prevents dispatchers from attempting to book a trip with a third-party fleet that appears available but has no real vehicles to serve the trip, reducing failed bookings and improving the reliability of the rematch tool.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved Screen Reader Accessibility for Maps (MOT-2352)**
  - _Resolution_: All interactive maps and their controls (e.g., zoom buttons, vehicle markers, route lines) are now hidden from screen readers. This provides a cleaner, more navigable experience for users of assistive technologies by focusing on data tables and lists rather than non-navigable visual map elements.

### 📊 Improved Visibility for Recurring Trip Groups

**What's New**  
We've enhanced how Recurring Trip Groups are displayed. You can now see the total number of requests associated with a trip group directly in the list view, and tooltips for requests in the *Shift Scheduling* view now show more accurate daily counts.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires the `tripGroup` feature flag.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Recurring Trips > [Select a recurring trip] > Recurring Trip Groups tab*: A new **Recurring Requests** column now shows the total count of requests in each group.
- *Launch > Shift Scheduling*: When you hover over a request that is part of a recurring trip, the tooltip now shows a daily request count and only displays the relevant trip group (e.g., inbound or outbound) instead of both.

#### What You Can Do
- Quickly assess the size of a trip group by viewing the request count in the table.
- Get more accurate, direction-specific information about a request's trip group from the Shift Scheduling view.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, it was difficult to quickly see how many requests were part of a trip group or to distinguish between inbound/outbound groups for a single request. This update provides clear, at-a-glance request counts and more precise tooltip information, making it easier for dispatchers and planners to manage recurring trips.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Live Requests Date Filtering (BUG-1043)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an "Internal Server Error" that occurred on the *Rides > Live Requests* page when filtering for a date entirely in the future. The page now correctly handles future date ranges without errors.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Driver/Dispatch Communications Stability (BUS-4356)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed a regression that caused the Driver/Dispatch communication feature to fail for some organizations. The system now correctly falls back to the appropriate credentials, restoring communication functionality.
