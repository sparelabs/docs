### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Duty Activity Feed Stability for Large Duties (MOT-2030)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed a validation error that caused the *Duties > [Duty] > Activity Log* tab to fail for duties with more than 20 requests. The system now correctly handles large volumes of activity data and ensures events with the exact same timestamp are sorted in a logical order (e.g., "In Progress" before "Arriving").

### 🏷️ Retain Context with "Dismissed" Badge on Driver Alerts

**What's New**  
When a driver behavior alert (e.g., Late Pullout, Unscheduled Stop) is dismissed from the Live Map watchlist, it will now remain visible in the duty details pane, but with a new "Dismissed" badge. This provides dispatchers with a complete history of driver events for the day, even after an alert has been acknowledged.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LiveMapAlerts` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Dispatch > Live Map* (select a duty with a dismissed alert, view the "Driver Behaviour" section in the duty details pane)

#### What You Can Do
- Dismiss a driver behavior alert from the Live Map watchlist.
- Observe that the alert is removed from the active watchlist.
- Select the associated duty on the map and see the alert is still listed in the duty pane, now with a "Dismissed" badge.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, dismissing an alert removed it from all views, erasing valuable operational context. This change ensures that dispatchers can see a full log of a driver's behavior throughout their duty, even after alerts are acknowledged, leading to more informed decision-making and better record-keeping.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Duplicate 'Request Cancelled' Entries in Duty Activity Feed (MOT-2030)**
  - _Resolution_: Corrected an issue that caused duplicate entries for cancelled requests to appear in the *Launch > Duties > [Duty] > Activity* tab. The feed now shows a single, more informative entry and displays data with improved real-time freshness.

- **Service V2 Configuration Page Fixes (MOT-2552)**
  - _Resolution_: Resolved two issues on the Service V2 configuration page (*Admin > Services*). Slider input fields (e.g., for detour multipliers) now correctly handle increments and manual typing, and editing stop coordinates now saves as expected.

- **Missing Result Modal After Adding First Duty Interruption (MOT-2519)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed a bug where the success/failure result modal would not appear after adding the very first interruption (break) to a duty that previously had none. The result modal now displays correctly in all scenarios when adding breaks via the *Launch > Duties > [Duty] > Itinerary* tab.

### 🚑 Emergency "Drop Off ASAP" Action

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
Dispatchers can now prioritize an immediate drop-off for an on-board rider experiencing an urgent situation. This action moves the rider's drop-off to the next stop in the vehicle's manifest, overriding the previously optimized schedule.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `dropoffAsap` feature flag and the `Request > Dropoff ASAP` permission. 

<Accordion title="See More">

#### What You Can Do
- For a rider who is currently on board, select the "Drop Off ASAP" action from the request's action menu.
- After confirming, the vehicle's manifest is immediately reordered to make that rider's drop-off the very next stop.
- The action is automatically logged in both the Request and Duty activity logs for auditing purposes.

#### Why This Matters
In situations requiring a rider to be dropped off urgently, dispatchers previously had to manually edit the manifest, which was time-consuming and error-prone. This feature provides a dedicated, one-click solution to re-prioritize a trip, ensuring a swift response during critical events.
</Accordion>

---
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved RPRH Metric Accuracy (MOT-2551)**

### 🔍 Filter by Multiple Cancellation Reasons in Workflows

**What's New**  
The Workflows module can now filter requests by multiple cancellation reasons at once. This allows for more complex and precise automation based on why a trip was cancelled.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Workflows > (when configuring a trigger or action that uses the 'Get Requests' step)*

#### What You Can Do
- Use a pipe-separated list (e.g., `noShow|lateDriver|other`) in the `requestCancellationReason` query parameter within a workflow step to fetch requests that match any of the specified reasons.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, workflows could only filter by a single cancellation reason, limiting automation possibilities. This change enables the creation of more sophisticated workflows that can handle different cancellation scenarios in a single rule.

### ⏱️ More Accurate Estimates for Third-Party Fleets During Rematch

**What's New**  
The system now distinguishes between real-time and "idealized" trip estimates from third-party fleets. When using the override modal to rematch a trip, only estimates based on actual fleet availability are shown, preventing bookings with fleets that may not have a vehicle available.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Live Requests > (select any request) > 'Rematch' button > Overrides modal*

#### What You Can Do
- When you use the rematch override modal, the list of available services will now exclude third-party fleets that provide only idealized estimates (estimates not based on real-time vehicle availability). Regular booking is unaffected.

#### Why This Matters
This prevents dispatchers from attempting to book a trip with a third-party fleet that appears available but has no real vehicles to serve the trip, reducing failed bookings and improving the reliability of the rematch tool.
</Accordion>

---
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved Screen Reader Accessibility for Maps (MOT-2352)**
  - _Resolution_: All interactive maps and their controls (e.g., zoom buttons, vehicle markers, route lines) are now hidden from screen readers. This provides a cleaner, more navigable experience for users of assistive technologies by focusing on data tables and lists rather than non-navigable visual map elements.

#### What You Can Do
- Quickly assess the size of a trip group by viewing the request count in the table.
- Get more accurate, direction-specific information about a request's trip group from the Shift Scheduling view.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, it was difficult to quickly see how many requests were part of a trip group or to distinguish between inbound/outbound groups for a single request. This update provides clear, at-a-glance request counts and more precise tooltip information, making it easier for dispatchers and planners to manage recurring trips.
</Accordion>
