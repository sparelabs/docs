### 📊 Improved Visibility for Recurring Trip Groups

**What's New**  
We've enhanced how Recurring Trip Groups are displayed. You can now see the total number of requests associated with a trip group directly in the list view, and tooltips for requests in the *Shift Scheduling* view now show more accurate daily counts.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires the `tripGroup` feature flag.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Recurring Trips > [Select a recurring trip] > Recurring Trip Groups tab*: A new **Recurring Requests** column now shows the total count of requests in each group.
- *Launch > Shift Scheduling*: When you hover over a request that is part of a recurring trip, the tooltip now shows a daily request count and only displays the relevant trip group (e.g., inbound or outbound) instead of both.

#### What You Can Do
- Quickly assess the size of a trip group by viewing the request count in the table.
- Get more accurate, direction-specific information about a request's trip group from the Shift Scheduling view.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, it was difficult to quickly see how many requests were part of a trip group or to distinguish between inbound/outbound groups for a single request. This update provides clear, at-a-glance request counts and more precise tooltip information, making it easier for dispatchers and planners to manage recurring trips.
