### 🗄️ Automatic Archiving of Duplicate Inspection Issues

**What's New**  
To prevent clutter and redundant work, the system now automatically archives older, open issues when a new issue is created from an inspection for the same item on the same asset.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) product
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *EAM > Assets > [Select an Asset] > Issues Tab*

#### What You Can Do
- **Reduced Duplication:** When an inspection is failed for an item that already has an existing open issue (and that issue is not part of a work order), the system automatically archives the old issue. The newly created issue becomes the single active one for that item.
- **Example Scenario:** A driver fails the "Tire Pressure" item on a pre-duty inspection for Vehicle 101. An issue is created. The next day, another driver fails the same item for the same vehicle. Instead of creating a second open issue, the system archives the first one and keeps the newest one active.
- **View Archived Issues:** You can still find historical issues by using the filters on the *Issues* tab to include archived items.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, repeated failures of the same inspection item would create multiple open issues for a single underlying problem, making it difficult to track and manage. This change ensures that only the most recent report for a specific problem remains active, streamlining the maintenance workflow.

### 🛡️ Automatic Voiding of Invalid Telematics Meter Entries

**What's New**  
The system now automatically detects and voids invalid meter entries synced from telematics providers. If a new meter reading is lower than a previous one (e.g., due to a device reset or data error), the entry is marked as "void" instead of causing the integration to fail.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required
- Requires Admin access to view meter entries

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- You will see the results in *Admin > EAM > Assets > [Select Asset] > Meter Entries tab*. Invalid entries synced from a telematics integration will have a "Void" status.

#### What You Can Do
- Previously, when a telematics integration sent a meter reading (e.g., mileage) that was chronologically later but numerically smaller than the last recorded value, the system would reject it, potentially halting the data sync.
- Now, the system will accept the entry but automatically mark it as `isVoid=true`, allowing subsequent valid data to continue syncing without interruption.

#### Why This Matters
Telematics data can sometimes be faulty, with incorrect readings causing integration errors that require manual intervention. This change makes the data ingestion process more resilient by automatically isolating bad data without halting the entire sync, ensuring that valid meter readings continue to be processed.
