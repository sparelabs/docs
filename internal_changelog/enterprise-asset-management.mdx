### ⛽ Manage and Sync Asset Fuel Levels

**What's New**  
You can now manually input, track, and filter assets by their fuel level. For organizations with telematics integrations, fuel levels can also be synced automatically from connected devices.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Enterprise Asset Management

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *EAM > Assets > (select an asset type with VIN/SN enabled) > Create/Edit Asset*: A new "Fuel Level (%)" input field is available.
- *EAM > Assets > Filters*: New "Fuel Level (Min)" and "Fuel Level (Max)" filters.
- *EAM > Assets > Columns*: A new "Fuel Level" column can be added to the asset list.
- *EAM > Assets > Asset Detail View*: The current fuel level is displayed.

#### What You Can Do
- Manually enter a fuel level percentage (0-100) when creating or editing an asset.
- Filter the asset list to find vehicles within a specific fuel level range.
- View the fuel level for assets in the list view and detail pages.

#### Why This Matters
This provides a more complete picture of an asset's status directly within Spare, helping with maintenance planning and operational readiness without needing to check external systems.

### 🗓️ Clearer Wording for Future Out-of-Service Dates

**What's New**  
The information banner on an asset's detail page now uses clearer, context-aware language to indicate if an asset's out-of-service date is in the past or scheduled for the future.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Enterprise Asset Management

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *EAM > Assets > (select an asset) > Lifecycle tab*: The information banner at the top of the view.

#### What You Can Do
- When an out-of-service date is set for the future, the banner will now read: "This asset **will be** taken out of service on [Date]".
- For past or current dates, the banner remains: "This asset **has been** taken out of service on [Date]".

#### Why This Matters
Previously, the banner always used past-tense wording, which could be confusing for assets scheduled to be taken out of service in the future. This change improves clarity and reduces misinterpretation of an asset's active status.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Asset Lifecycle Resale Value Accepts Zero (EAM-585)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where the "Estimated Lifecycle Resale Value" field for an asset would not accept `0` as a valid input. The system now correctly handles a zero-dollar resale value, and related validation error messages now appear under the correct fields.
- **Inventory Adjustment Defaults to Current Quantity (EAM-544)**
  - _Resolution_: When using the "Adjust Inventory" action for a part, the "Actual Quantity" input field now defaults to the part's "Current Quantity" instead of `0`. This helps prevent accidental zeroing-out of inventory levels.

### 🔧 "General" Tasks to Bypass Part Recommendations

**What's New**  
You can now mark a Service Task as "General." When a technician adds a general task to a Work Order, the system will not show historical part recommendations, streamlining the workflow for catch-all or miscellaneous tasks.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *EAM > Service Tasks > [Edit a Task]* (a new "General" checkbox is available).
- *EAM > Work Orders > [Create/Edit a Work Order]* (when adding a line item, a hint appears for general tasks).

#### What You Can Do
- Edit a Service Task and check the **General** box to designate it as a catch-all task.
- When this task is added to a work order, technicians will see a hint: "No parts recommendations, this is for catch all tasks."

#### Why This Matters
Not all maintenance tasks have predictable part requirements. This feature allows you to create general service tasks (e.g., "General Inspection," "Miscellaneous Repair") without triggering unnecessary part recommendations, making the work order creation process faster.
