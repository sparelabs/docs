### 🔧 "General" Service Tasks for Simplified Work Orders

**What's New**  
You can now mark a Service Task as "General." When a "General" task is added to a Work Order, the system will not show historical parts recommendations, streamlining the process for catch-all or miscellaneous tasks.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access with EAM permissions.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *EAM > Service Tasks > [Edit a Task]* (a new "General" checkbox is available).
- *EAM > Work Orders > [Create/Edit a Work Order]* (when adding a line item, a hint appears below the service task selector for "General" tasks).

#### What You Can Do
- Designate specific service tasks as "General" to signify they don't require specific parts.
- When creating a work order, select a "General" task to bypass the parts recommendation step. A hint will display: "No parts recommendations, this is for catch all tasks."

#### Why This Matters
This allows you to create generic service tasks (e.g., "General Inspection," "Miscellaneous Repair") without being prompted for parts, making it faster to log work that doesn't have a predictable parts list.

## 🏢 Enterprise Asset Management
### 📝 Add Notes and Track Task Completion in Work Orders

**What's New**  
You can now add notes to both an overall work order and its individual line items. A new "Completed" column also allows you to quickly mark service tasks as complete directly from the line items list.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires permissions to access the Enterprise Asset Management module and manage Work Orders.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Enterprise Asset Management > Work Orders > [Select a Work Order]*.

#### What You Can Do
- Add free-text information to a work order using the new **Notes** field.
- Add specific notes to each task in the "Line Items" table, which are saved automatically.
- Mark a task as complete using the new checkbox in the **Completed** column.

#### Why This Matters
Technicians and managers often need to document extra details or context that doesn't fit into standard fields. This update allows for better record-keeping and communication within a work order, and the task completion checkbox provides a clear, at-a-glance view of its progress.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved EAM Search for Multi-Word Queries (EAM-506)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where searching for terms containing spaces (e.g., "brake pads") in the Enterprise Asset Management search bar failed to return results. The system now correctly handles multi-word search queries.
