### 🗄️ Automatic Archiving of Duplicate Inspection Issues

**What's New**  
To prevent clutter and redundant work, the system now automatically archives older, open issues when a new issue is created from an inspection for the same item on the same asset.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) product
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *EAM > Assets > [Select an Asset] > Issues Tab*

#### What You Can Do
- **Reduced Duplication:** When an inspection is failed for an item that already has an existing open issue (and that issue is not part of a work order), the system automatically archives the old issue. The newly created issue becomes the single active one for that item.
- **Example Scenario:** A driver fails the "Tire Pressure" item on a pre-duty inspection for Vehicle 101. An issue is created. The next day, another driver fails the same item for the same vehicle. Instead of creating a second open issue, the system archives the first one and keeps the newest one active.
- **View Archived Issues:** You can still find historical issues by using the filters on the *Issues* tab to include archived items.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, repeated failures of the same inspection item would create multiple open issues for a single underlying problem, making it difficult to track and manage. This change ensures that only the most recent report for a specific problem remains active, streamlining the maintenance workflow.

### 🔢 Automatic Comma Formatting for Meter Entries

**What's New**  
When entering a new meter reading for a vehicle, the input field now automatically adds commas as you type (e.g., typing `100000` displays as `100,000`). This improves readability and helps prevent data entry errors for large numbers.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `VehicleInspections` feature flag and Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Enterprise Asset Management > Vehicles > (Select a vehicle) > Meter History > Add Meter Entry* (in the "Reading" field)
- *Enterprise Asset Management > Issues > (Select an issue) > Add Meter Entry* (in the "Reading" field)

#### What You Can Do
- Type a numerical value into the "Reading" field when adding a meter entry. Commas will be automatically inserted to format the number.
- The unit of distance (e.g., "mi" or "km") based on your organization's settings is now displayed next to the input field for clarity.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, large meter readings were hard to read and verify, increasing the chance of typos. The new automatic formatting makes it easier to input and confirm high-mileage or high-hour readings accurately.

### 🛡️ Automatic Voiding of Invalid Telematics Meter Entries

**What's New**  
The system now automatically detects and voids invalid meter entries synced from telematics providers. If a new meter reading is lower than a previous one (e.g., due to a device reset or data error), the entry is marked as "void" instead of causing the integration to fail.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required
- Requires Admin access to view meter entries

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- You will see the results in *Admin > EAM > Assets > [Select Asset] > Meter Entries tab*. Invalid entries synced from a telematics integration will have a "Void" status.

#### What You Can Do
- Previously, when a telematics integration sent a meter reading (e.g., mileage) that was chronologically later but numerically smaller than the last recorded value, the system would reject it, potentially halting the data sync.
- Now, the system will accept the entry but automatically mark it as `isVoid=true`, allowing subsequent valid data to continue syncing without interruption.

#### Why This Matters
Telematics data can sometimes be faulty, with incorrect readings causing integration errors that require manual intervention. This change makes the data ingestion process more resilient by automatically isolating bad data without halting the entire sync, ensuring that valid meter readings continue to be processed.

A new "Energy Entries" tab is now available on the asset detail page. This tab appears automatically for any asset belonging to an asset type that has been configured to track energy, providing a centralized place to view its energy history.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *EAM > Assets > (select an asset)* (new "Energy Entries" tab)
- *EAM > Energy Entries > Add Energy Entry* (form fields)

#### What You Can Do
- View a filtered list of all energy entries for a specific asset directly from its detail page.
- Click the "Add Energy Entry" button from the tab, which pre-fills the form with the current asset.
- Notice that the "Meter Entry" field on the energy entry form now only appears if the selected asset's type is configured for meter readings.

#### Why This Matters
Tracking energy consumption for a specific vehicle or asset was difficult, requiring you to search and filter the main Energy Entries list. This change provides a dedicated, filtered view on the asset's detail page, making it much easier to monitor an individual asset's energy usage.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved Vehicle Asset Creation from Operations (EAM-660)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where creating a vehicle in Operations without filling in all fields could result in an incomplete asset record in EAM. Now, missing required fields (e.g., make, model, license plate, year) are populated with safe default values ('-' or 0) to ensure a complete record is created.

- **Large Meter Entry Warning Restored (EAM-639)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed a bug where the warning for creating a meter entry with an unusually large value (e.g., a typo like 150,000 instead of 15,000) was not triggering correctly. The validation logic has been fixed, and the warning now appears as expected.
