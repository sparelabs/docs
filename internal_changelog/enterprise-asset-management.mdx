## 🏢 Enterprise Asset Management
### 📝 Add Notes and Track Task Completion in Work Orders

**What's New**  
You can now add notes to both an overall work order and its individual line items. A new "Completed" column also allows you to quickly mark service tasks as complete directly from the line items list.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires permissions to access the Enterprise Asset Management module and manage Work Orders.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Enterprise Asset Management > Work Orders > [Select a Work Order]*.

#### What You Can Do
- Add free-text information to a work order using the new **Notes** field.
- Add specific notes to each task in the "Line Items" table, which are saved automatically.
- Mark a task as complete using the new checkbox in the **Completed** column.

#### Why This Matters
Technicians and managers often need to document extra details or context that doesn't fit into standard fields. This update allows for better record-keeping and communication within a work order, and the task completion checkbox provides a clear, at-a-glance view of its progress.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved EAM Search for Multi-Word Queries (EAM-506)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where searching for terms containing spaces (e.g., "brake pads") in the Enterprise Asset Management search bar failed to return results. The system now correctly handles multi-word search queries.
