### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Improved Vehicle Asset Creation from Operations (EAM-660)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where creating a vehicle in Operations without filling in all fields could result in an incomplete asset record in EAM. Now, missing required fields (e.g., make, model, license plate, year) are populated with safe default values ('-' or 0) to ensure a complete record is created.

- **Large Meter Entry Warning Restored (EAM-639)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed a bug where the warning for creating a meter entry with an unusually large value (e.g., a typo like 150,000 instead of 15,000) was not triggering correctly. The validation logic has been fixed, and the warning now appears as expected.

### 🗓️ Clearer Wording for Future Out-of-Service Dates

**What's New**  
The information banner on an asset's detail page now uses clearer, context-aware language to indicate if an asset's out-of-service date is in the past or scheduled for the future.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with permissions for Enterprise Asset Management

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *EAM > Assets > (select an asset) > Lifecycle tab*: The information banner at the top of the view.

#### What You Can Do
- When an out-of-service date is set for the future, the banner will now read: "This asset **will be** taken out of service on [Date]".
- For past or current dates, the banner remains: "This asset **has been** taken out of service on [Date]".

#### Why This Matters
Previously, the banner always used past-tense wording, which could be confusing for assets scheduled to be taken out of service in the future. This change improves clarity and reduces misinterpretation of an asset's active status.
</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Asset Lifecycle Resale Value Accepts Zero (EAM-585)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where the "Estimated Lifecycle Resale Value" field for an asset would not accept `0` as a valid input. The system now correctly handles a zero-dollar resale value, and related validation error messages now appear under the correct fields.
- **Inventory Adjustment Defaults to Current Quantity (EAM-544)**
  - _Resolution_: When using the "Adjust Inventory" action for a part, the "Actual Quantity" input field now defaults to the part's "Current Quantity" instead of `0`. This helps prevent accidental zeroing-out of inventory levels.
