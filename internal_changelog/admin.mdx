### 🛡️ Safer and More Resilient Organization Deletion

**What's New**  
The organization deletion process for Super Admins has been made more robust. Deletion can now be safely re-triggered on an already archived (soft-deleted) organization to resume the process. Additionally, a new safeguard prevents the deletion of an organization if it has requests associated with a shared fleet from another organization.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a backend process typically triggered via API by Super Admins.

#### What You Can Do
- Trigger the deletion of an organization that was previously archived but not fully deleted, and the process will resume where it left off.
- If you attempt to delete an organization with shared fleet dependencies, the system will now block the action and return an error message: `This organization cannot be deleted because it has requests that are part of a fleet shared with another organization.`

#### Why This Matters
Previously, a failed deletion could leave an organization in an unrecoverable state, and there were no checks for cross-organization dependencies, risking data integrity. This enhancement makes the process more reliable and prevents accidental data loss in complex multi-organization (Open Fleets) environments.
</Accordion>

### ⚙️ Improved Service Configuration Experience

**What's New**  
The service configuration page has been updated with several quality-of-life improvements. These include a sticky header for easier saving, persistent edits when switching between tabs, and a redesigned overview tab to streamline the editing process.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *System Settings > Services > [Select a Service]*: The entire page for editing a service has been enhanced.

#### What You Can Do
- **Save from Anywhere**: The header containing the 'Save', 'Revert', and 'Actions' buttons now stays visible as you scroll, so you no longer need to scroll to the top to save your changes.
- **Switch Tabs Without Losing Work**: Your unsaved changes are now preserved when you switch between tabs (e.g., from 'Overview' to 'Zones').
- **Better Map Interaction**: When editing a zone, the map now correctly zooms to fit the zone's boundaries automatically.

#### Why This Matters
These changes significantly improve the workflow for configuring services. The sticky header removes tedious scrolling, and persisting edits across tabs prevents accidental data loss, making complex service setups faster and less error-prone.

### ⏱️ Enhanced Date & Time Handling in Workflows

**What's New**  
Two new Handlebars helpers, `parseDate` and `parseDatetime`, are now available in the Workflows feature. These helpers convert date strings from sources like custom fields into timestamps, enabling date-based comparisons within workflow filter steps.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *System Settings > Workflows*: The new helpers can be used in the "Filter" step when building or editing a workflow.

#### What You Can Do
- Use `{{parseDate 'YYYY-MM-DD'}}` to handle date-only strings, converting them to a timestamp based on your organization's timezone.
- Use `{{parseDatetime 'ISO_8601_STRING'}}` to handle full datetime strings.
- Create workflows that trigger based on date comparisons. For example, you can now build a workflow to send an email when a driver's license (stored in a custom field) is 30 days from expiring by comparing `{{parseDate driver.metadata.driversLicenseExpiry}}` to `{{addTs (currentTs) 30 'days'}}`.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, workflow filters only supported numeric comparisons, making it impossible to automate actions based on dates stored as text. These helpers unlock powerful time-based automation for scenarios like credential expiry reminders, appointment follow-ups, and other date-driven processes.

### 🚨 Automated Incident Creation from Driver Breaks

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - Built for Demo' and is not yet ready for customer use. Reach out to the Product team with questions.</Warning>

**What's New**  
You can now designate specific driver break reasons as "Incidents." When a dispatcher starts a break for a driver using one of these reasons, the system automatically creates an associated Incident case in Resolve for immediate tracking and follow-up.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `IncidentReporting` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *System Settings > Operations > Driver Break Reasons*: A new **Incident** toggle column is now available in the table.
- *Rides > Live Map > [Select Duty] > Add Break*: When creating a break, a confirmation modal will appear if an incident-flagged reason is chosen.

#### What You Can Do
- First, activate the "Incident" case type template from *Resolve > Case Types*.
- In settings, enable the "Incident" toggle for any break reason that should trigger an incident report (e.g., "Vehicle Accident," "Mechanical Failure").
- When a dispatcher logs a break with that reason, a modal will confirm the creation of an Incident case and provide a direct link to edit the new case in Resolve.

#### Why This Matters
This feature creates a direct, automated link between an operational event and the administrative follow-up process. It ensures that critical incidents are captured and documented in Resolve immediately, reducing manual data entry, preventing missed reports, and improving response time.
</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Corrected Error Response for Invalid Import Status Checks (BUS-4732)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where checking the status of a non-existent data import would cause a generic `500 Internal Server Error`. The system now correctly returns a `404 Not Found` error, providing a more accurate response for automated tools and integrations.

### 🎟️ Promo Code Validity Based on Pickup Time

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
A new setting allows promo code validity to be determined by the trip's requested pickup time, rather than the time the trip was booked. This ensures promotions are applied only to trips that actually occur within the valid time frame.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `PromoPeriodBasedOnPickup` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a backend change that affects how promo codes are validated during trip booking in the Rider App, Rider Web, and Admin booking.

#### What You Can Do
- **Enable Pickup-Based Validation:** When the feature flag is active, the system checks the promo's `start` and `expiry` date against the trip's requested pickup time.
- **Example Scenario:** You create a promo valid only on December 25th.
  - **Without the flag:** A rider booking a trip on December 24th for travel on the 25th cannot apply the promo, because the booking time is outside the valid period.
  - **With the flag:** The same rider can successfully apply the promo, because the trip's pickup time falls within the valid period.

#### Why This Matters
This change provides more precise control over promotions, especially for advance bookings. It ensures that discounts are correctly applied based on when the service is rendered, not just when it is requested, preventing unintended usage outside of promotional periods.
</Accordion>

### 📜 New Activity Log Events for Service Zones and Stops

**What's New**  
The activity log for a service now provides a complete audit trail of all changes made to its zones and stops. Any creation, update, or deletion of these geographic components is now recorded.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Launch > Services > [Select a Service] > Activity Log Tab*
- *System > Events*

#### What You Can Do
- **Track Changes:** View a detailed history of all modifications to a service's zones and stops directly within the service's own activity log.
- **Audit Geofences:** See exactly who created, updated, or deleted a zone or stop, and when the change occurred. This is useful for troubleshooting service behavior or reviewing configuration history.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, changes to service geometry like zones and stops were not logged, making it difficult to audit historical configurations. This enhancement brings full transparency to service management, ensuring every change is tracked and accounted for.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **AI Chat Analytics Block Rendering (AIP-682, AIP-683)**
  * _Resolution_: Improved the reliability of displaying analytics charts and tables within AI Chat conversations. The system now better handles the data stream from the AI, preventing rendering failures caused by malformed content.

- **Service Zone and Time Rule Configuration**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed two issues in the Service configuration page:
    1. The "Merge Zones" map display now correctly respects the `MergeZonesOnServicesPage` feature flag.
    2. When creating a new Time Rule from within the Zone edit pane, the new rule now correctly appears in the selection dropdown without requiring a page refresh.

### 🛡️ Restricted Services Now a Standard Feature

**What's New**  
The ability to restrict a service to specific user groups is now a standard feature available to all organizations. The "Is Restricted" setting is always available when configuring a service.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required (previously required `restrictedServices` feature flag).
- Requires Admin access to configure services.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Admin > Services > (Select a Service) > Edit* (the "Is Restricted" checkbox is now permanently visible in the service configuration)

#### What You Can Do
- Mark any service as "restricted" to limit who can book trips on it.
- Grant booking permissions for these services to specific user groups via the `WRITE_RESTRICTED_SERVICE_REQUEST` permission.

### 🗺️ Set Favorite Location with an Interactive Map

**What's New**  
When adding or editing a rider's favorite location, you can now use an interactive map to precisely set the address coordinates. This allows for fine-tuning the location pin, which is especially useful for large venues like malls or airports.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Riders > Rider List > [Select a Rider] > Favorite Locations* (in the "Add Favorite Location" or "Edit Favorite Location" modal)

#### What You Can Do
- Search for an address as usual. A map will appear showing the location.
- Drag the pin on the map to adjust the exact pickup or drop-off spot. The address field will update automatically based on the new pin location.

#### Why This Matters
Address search doesn't always place the pin in the most convenient spot for riders, especially in large areas. This feature gives admins the ability to manually adjust the location to a specific entrance or pickup point, improving accuracy and the rider's experience.
</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Rider Import with Duplicate Phone Numbers (BUS-4733)**
  * _Resolution_: The rider import process (*Data > Riders > Import Riders*) will now correctly allow multiple riders to have the same phone number, as long as the organization setting "Use phone number for authentication" is disabled. This aligns the import validation with the platform's overall authentication rules.

### 📝 Improved Form and Custom Field Configuration

**What's New**  
We've introduced several quality-of-life improvements for managing custom fields and forms. You can now reorder choice options via drag-and-drop, edit the labels of existing choices without changing their underlying value, and quickly identify required fields in your forms with a new "Required" indicator.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- **Choice Reordering & Editing**: *Settings > Field Manager > [Select a Single/Multiple Choice Field]* (in the "Choices" section). This also applies to choice-based fields within the Engage form builder at *Engage > Case Types > [Select Case Type] > Forms*.
- **Required Indicator**: *Engage > Case Types > [Select Case Type] > Forms* (in the list of fields within the form builder, next to the visibility text).

- Click the search bar in the sidebar of an MFE (like EAM) to trigger the Superbox.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, the global search was only accessible from the main application, forcing users to navigate away from modules like EAM to perform a search. This change provides a consistent and seamless search experience across the entire platform.

### 🔑 Faster Organization Access Requests for Super Admins

**What's New**  
When a Super Admin requests access to an organization, the "Administrator" role is now selected by default in the request form.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- The "Request Access" modal that appears when a Super Admin tries to access an organization they do not have permissions for.

#### What You Can Do
- Submit access requests more quickly, as the most common role ("Administrator") is pre-selected.
- You can still manually select a different role from the dropdown if needed.

#### Why This Matters
This streamlines the workflow for Super Admins by removing a repetitive step, as "Administrator" is the most frequently requested role.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **"Navigate to Organization" Button Now Works Correctly (SEC-69)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where the "Navigate to Organization" button in the access request approval modal would close the dialog but fail to switch to the target organization. The button now correctly navigates as expected.
- **Rider Creation with "Contact Only" Phone Numbers (ENG-1000)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed a bug that prevented creating a new rider from modals (e.g., when adding a rider to a new Case or Request) if their "Contact Only" phone number was already in use by another rider. This flow now works consistently with the main rider creation page.
- **Workflow Search Now Handles Multiple Words (ENG-1001)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue in *Settings > Workflows* where searching for a workflow using multiple words (e.g., "Rider Cancellation") would fail. The search now correctly handles spaces and returns the expected results.

### 🔑 Just-in-Time (JIT) Access Requests for Organizations

**What's New**  
A new self-serve system allows Spare employees (Super Admins) to request temporary, role-based access to customer organizations. This workflow includes justification, approvals, and automatic revocation, enhancing security and auditability.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- The organization selection page after login (*Select Organization*)
- *Super Admin > Organizations > (select an org) > 'Request Access' button*
- A new top-level *Access Requests* page in the sidebar

#### What You Can Do
- Request access to an organization for a specific duration and role, with a justification.
- Designated approvers are notified to approve or deny the request.
- Track the status of your requests and see when access will expire.
- Manage all access requests and approval policies from the new "Access Requests" page.

#### Why This Matters
This replaces manual access grants with a structured, auditable, and time-bound system. It ensures that access to customer environments is granted on a need-to-know basis with the principle of least privilege, improving security and compliance.

### 🔎 Make Address and Phone Number Custom Fields Searchable

**What's New**  
You can now enable searching on custom fields of type "Address" and "Phone Number". Previously, only Text, Number, and Date fields could be made searchable.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Field Manager > (select a field group) > (create or edit a custom field)*

#### What You Can Do
- When creating or editing a custom field for Riders or Requests, if you select the "Address" or "Phone Number" type, you can now check the "Searchable" box. This allows users to find riders or requests by searching for values in those fields.

#### Why This Matters
This expands search capabilities, making it easier for dispatchers and admins to locate records using important contact or location information stored in custom fields.

### 💳 Enhanced Stripe Configuration Validation

**What's New**  
The system now validates Stripe API keys when you save a Stripe payment provider configuration. It checks that the secret key is valid and that the publishable and secret keys are not mismatched (e.g., one Test key and one Live key).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Payment > Payment Providers > (creating or editing a Stripe provider)*

#### What You Can Do
- When you enter Stripe API keys, the system will prevent you from saving if the keys are invalid or if there's a mismatch between Live and Test environments, showing a specific error message.

#### Why This Matters
This prevents misconfigurations that could lead to payment processing failures. By catching errors during setup, it ensures that the payment integration is correctly configured before it's used.

### ✉️ Option to Skip Welcome Email for New Admins

**What's New**  
When creating a new administrator account via the API, you can now choose to skip sending the automated welcome email by using the `skipWelcomeEmail` parameter.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions to create new admins.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is an API-only enhancement available on the endpoint for creating administrators. It is not exposed in the admin user interface.

#### What You Can Do
- Programmatically create new admin accounts without triggering a welcome email.

#### Why This Matters
This is useful for scenarios like temporary Just-In-Time (JIT) access, where an employee is granted short-term admin rights and a welcome email is unnecessary. It helps reduce email clutter for internal or temporary accounts.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Driver/Dispatch Communication Service Stability (BUS-4356)**
  - _Resolution_: Restored a fallback mechanism for driver/dispatch communications. Systems that use this feature but do not have their own Twilio connection will now correctly use the platform's default service, preventing communication failures.

### 🔧 Configurable Read-Only External Rider IDs

**What's New**  
A new feature is available to make the `External Rider ID` field on a rider's profile read-only. This is designed for organizations where this ID is managed by an external system and should not be editable by agents in Spare Admin.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ReadOnlyExternalRiderIds` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *People > Riders > [Select a Rider]* (the `External Rider ID` field in the rider's profile details).

#### What You Can Do
- When this feature is enabled for your organization, the `External Rider ID` field will be visible but not editable, preventing accidental changes by staff.

#### Why This Matters
This ensures data integrity for rider IDs that are synced from an external source of truth, preventing discrepancies between systems.

### ⚙️ Just-in-Time (JIT) Access for Spare Employees (Super Admins)

**What's New**  
A new system has been implemented for Spare employees (Super Admins) to request temporary, time-bound access to customer organizations. This provides a formal, auditable workflow for granting access for support and configuration purposes. (Note: The user interface for this feature will be released separately).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is primarily a backend system that governs Super Admin access. The effects will be visible in audit logs and future administrative UIs.

#### What You Can Do

- Access is automatically revoked when the approved time expires.
- All requests and approvals are logged for a complete audit trail.

#### Why This Matters
This system enhances security and accountability by replacing persistent access with a "least privilege" model. It ensures that access to customer data is granted only when necessary, for a limited time, and with full transparency.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required.
- Requires Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > System > Workflows* (in the page header).

#### What You Can Do
