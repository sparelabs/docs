### 🔍 Search and Navigate Workflows More Easily

**What's New**  
The Workflows list page now includes an autocomplete search bar to quickly find workflows by name. Additionally, you can now right-click, middle-click, or Cmd/Ctrl+click on a workflow row to open it in a new tab.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required.
- Requires Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > System > Workflows* (in the page header).

#### What You Can Do
- Use the new search bar at the top of the page to filter the list of workflows as you type.
- Right-click any workflow row to open the browser's context menu (e.g., 'Open in new tab').
- Use standard browser shortcuts like Cmd/Ctrl+click or middle-click to open workflows in new tabs.

#### Why This Matters
Finding a specific workflow was difficult in organizations with long lists, and opening multiple workflows for comparison required manual URL handling. This change streamlines navigation and makes managing many workflows much easier and more efficient.
