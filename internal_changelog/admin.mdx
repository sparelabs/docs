### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Data Import Status Check (BUS-4732)**
  - _Resolution_: Corrected an error where checking the status of a non-existent data import would cause a server error (500). The system now correctly returns a "not found" (404) response as expected.

### ⚙️ Compare Dates in Workflows with New Helpers

**What's New**  
Two new Handlebars helpers, `parseDate` and `parseDatetime`, are now available in Workflows. These allow you to convert date and datetime strings from custom fields or other data sources into a numerical format (Unix timestamp) for comparisons in Filter steps.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > System > Workflows* (within the "Filter" step of a workflow configuration)

#### What You Can Do
- Use `{{parseDate 'YYYY-MM-DD'}}` to convert a date string into a timestamp, correctly handled in your organization's timezone.
- Use `{{parseDatetime 'ISO_8601_STRING'}}` to convert a full datetime string into a timestamp.
- **Example Scenario**: Create a workflow that sends an email 30 days before a driver's license expires. In a Filter step, you can now compare a `driversLicenseExpiry` custom field to the current date by checking if `{{parseDate driver.metadata.driversLicenseExpiry}}` is less than `{{addTs (currentTs) 30 'days'}}`.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, you could not perform date-based comparisons in workflow filters because they only supported numerical values. This enhancement unlocks new automation possibilities, such as triggering actions based on upcoming expiry dates stored in custom fields.

### 🗺️ Select Map Styles When Setting Favorite Locations

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
When adding or editing a favorite location, you can now switch between "Street", "Satellite", and "Detailed" map views. This helps you precisely place the pin, especially in complex areas like malls, airports, or large campuses.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ExperimentalMapStyles` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Data > Favorite Locations > Add Favorite Location*: A new "Map Layers" dropdown appears in the top-right corner of the map.

#### What You Can Do
- Click the "Map Layers" dropdown to choose from three map styles: "Street" (the default), "Satellite" (aerial imagery), or "Detailed" (a hybrid view with labels).
- Use the satellite or detailed view to identify the exact building entrance or pickup spot before saving the favorite location.

#### Why This Matters
Setting a precise location pin using only a street map can be difficult for large or poorly mapped areas. The ability to switch to a satellite or detailed view gives you the visual context needed to save the correct location with confidence.

### ⚙️ Improved Service Creation and Editing Experience

**What's New**  
The service configuration pages have been updated for a smoother, more intuitive workflow. Key improvements include a sticky header so you don't lose context, the ability to switch tabs without losing unsaved changes, and a better layout on the "Overview" tab.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Planning > Services* (on the main list and within the service editing pages)

#### What You Can Do
- **Navigate Without Losing Work**: You can now switch between tabs (e.g., from "Overview" to "Eligibility") without being forced to save or discard your changes first. Your edits are preserved as you move between sections.
- **Always See Key Actions**: When scrolling down a long service configuration page, the header containing the service name and "Save" button now remains visible at the top.
- **View a Cleaner Overview**: The "Overview" tab has been redesigned with a cleaner, two-column layout for service details.
- **Experience Smarter Zone Editing**: The map now zooms more intelligently to fit the boundaries of the zone you are editing.

#### Why This Matters
Editing complex services often requires moving between different tabs, and the previous workflow could cause users to accidentally lose their work. These changes create a more seamless and forgiving editing experience, preventing frustration and saving time.

### 🏷️ Renamed and Reorganized Feature Flag Packages

### 🔑 Faster Organization Access Requests for Super Admins

**What's New**

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- The "Request Access" modal that appears when a Super Admin tries to access an organization they do not have permissions for.

#### What You Can Do

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **"Navigate to Organization" Button Now Works Correctly (SEC-69)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where the "Navigate to Organization" button in the access request approval modal would close the dialog but fail to switch to the target organization. The button now correctly navigates as expected.
- **Rider Creation with "Contact Only" Phone Numbers (ENG-1000)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed a bug that prevented creating a new rider from modals (e.g., when adding a rider to a new Case or Request) if their "Contact Only" phone number was already in use by another rider. This flow now works consistently with the main rider creation page.
- **Workflow Search Now Handles Multiple Words (ENG-1001)**

### 💳 Enhanced Stripe Configuration Validation

**What's New**  
The system now validates Stripe API keys when you save a Stripe payment provider configuration. It checks that the secret key is valid and that the publishable and secret keys are not mismatched (e.g., one Test key and one Live key).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Payment > Payment Providers > (creating or editing a Stripe provider)*

#### What You Can Do

### ⚙️ Just-in-Time (JIT) Access for Spare Employees (Super Admins)

**What's New**  
A new system has been implemented for Spare employees (Super Admins) to request temporary, time-bound access to customer organizations.
