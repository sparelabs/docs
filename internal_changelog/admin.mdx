### ✉️ Option to Skip Welcome Email for New Admins

**What's New**  
When creating a new administrator account via the API, you can now choose to skip sending the automated welcome email by using the `skipWelcomeEmail` parameter.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions to create new admins.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is an API-only enhancement available on the endpoint for creating administrators. It is not exposed in the admin user interface.

#### What You Can Do
- Programmatically create new admin accounts without triggering a welcome email.

#### Why This Matters
This is useful for scenarios like temporary Just-In-Time (JIT) access, where an employee is granted short-term admin rights and a welcome email is unnecessary. It helps reduce email clutter for internal or temporary accounts.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Driver/Dispatch Communication Service Stability (BUS-4356)**
  - _Resolution_: Restored a fallback mechanism for driver/dispatch communications. Systems that use this feature but do not have their own Twilio connection will now correctly use the platform's default service, preventing communication failures.

### 🔧 Configurable Read-Only External Rider IDs

**What's New**  
A new feature is available to make the `External Rider ID` field on a rider's profile read-only. This is designed for organizations where this ID is managed by an external system and should not be editable by agents in Spare Admin.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ReadOnlyExternalRiderIds` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *People > Riders > [Select a Rider]* (the `External Rider ID` field in the rider's profile details).

#### What You Can Do
- When this feature is enabled for your organization, the `External Rider ID` field will be visible but not editable, preventing accidental changes by staff.

#### Why This Matters
This ensures data integrity for rider IDs that are synced from an external source of truth, preventing discrepancies between systems.

### ⚙️ Just-in-Time (JIT) Access for Spare Employees (Super Admins)

**What's New**  
A new system has been implemented for Spare employees (Super Admins) to request temporary, time-bound access to customer organizations. This provides a formal, auditable workflow for granting access for support and configuration purposes. (Note: The user interface for this feature will be released separately).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is primarily a backend system that governs Super Admin access. The effects will be visible in audit logs and future administrative UIs.

#### What You Can Do
- Spare employees can request access to an organization for a specific duration and with a clear justification.
- Access is automatically revoked when the approved time expires.
- All requests and approvals are logged for a complete audit trail.

#### Why This Matters
This system enhances security and accountability by replacing persistent access with a "least privilege" model. It ensures that access to customer data is granted only when necessary, for a limited time, and with full transparency.

### 🔍 Search and Navigate Workflows More Easily

**What's New**  
The Workflows list page now includes an autocomplete search bar to quickly find workflows by name. Additionally, you can now right-click, middle-click, or Cmd/Ctrl+click on a workflow row to open it in a new tab.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required.
- Requires Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > System > Workflows* (in the page header).

#### What You Can Do
- Use the new search bar at the top of the page to filter the list of workflows as you type.
- Right-click any workflow row to open the browser's context menu (e.g., 'Open in new tab').
- Use standard browser shortcuts like Cmd/Ctrl+click or middle-click to open workflows in new tabs.

#### Why This Matters
Finding a specific workflow was difficult in organizations with long lists, and opening multiple workflows for comparison required manual URL handling. This change streamlines navigation and makes managing many workflows much easier and more efficient.
