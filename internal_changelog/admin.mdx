### 🔒 Read-Only External Rider IDs

**What's New**  
A new feature is available to make the `External Rider ID` field read-only in the Admin UI. This is designed for organizations where call center agents and other staff should be able to view but not edit these IDs.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ReadOnlyExternalRiderIds` feature flag.
- Requires Administrator access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Data > Riders > [Select a Rider]* (the "External Rider ID" field will be non-editable).
- *Requests > Create Request* (the "External Rider ID" field will be non-editable if a rider is selected).

#### What You Can Do
- Once enabled, administrators can prevent users from changing the External Rider ID on a rider's profile.
- This ensures data integrity for IDs that are synchronized with or managed by an external system.

#### Why This Matters
This feature prevents accidental or unauthorized changes to critical external rider identifiers, which are often the primary key for linking riders to other software systems.

### ⏱️ Just-in-Time (JIT) Access Requests for Organizations

**What's New**  
A new system allows Spare employees with Super Admin roles to request temporary, time-bound access to customer organizations. This workflow includes justification, configurable approval policies, duration limits, and automatic access revocation upon expiry.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a new access management system for Spare-internal Super Admins. The user interface for this system will be released in an upcoming update.

#### What You Can Do
- **Requesters:** Submit requests for temporary access to an organization, specifying a role, duration, and justification.
- **Approvers:** Receive notifications (via Slack or Spare Admin) and can approve or deny access requests.
- **Policy Admins:** Configure organization-specific access policies, such as requiring approvals or setting maximum access durations.

#### Why This Matters
This enhances security and compliance by replacing long-lived, standing access with a formal, audited, and time-limited request process. It ensures that access to customer data is granted only when necessary and for the shortest duration required.
