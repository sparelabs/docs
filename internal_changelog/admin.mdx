### ♿ New Accessibility Features for Uber Fleets

**What's New**  
When configuring an Open Fleet with Uber as the provider, you can now specify additional accessibility options: `ActualDoorToDoor`, `ChildSeatBaby`, and `ChildSeatYoung`.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access to manage Fleets

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Spare Operations > Service Planning > Fleets* > Add or Edit an Open Fleet with provider "Uber".

#### What You Can Do
- In the fleet settings, enable the **"Accessibility Features"** checkbox.
- Click **"Add Accessibility Features"**.
- The new options will appear in the **"Type"** dropdown menu, alongside existing options like `Wheelchair`.

#### Why This Matters
This enhancement allows you to offer more granular accessibility services for trips fulfilled by Uber. By passing these specific requirements, you can ensure riders are matched with vehicles that meet their exact needs, such as those that can accommodate young children or provide door-to-door assistance.

### 🏷️ Renamed and Reorganized Feature Flag Packages

**What's New**  
The package names for feature flags related to Spare Engage (Resolve and Eligibility) have been updated in the Super Admin interface to be more descriptive. This is a cosmetic change to improve clarity and does not alter any feature functionality.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super Admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Super Admin > Organizations > [Select an Organization] > Feature Flags tab*

#### What You Can Do
- Observe the updated package names when managing feature flags for an organization.
- **Before:** `Spare Eligibility Platform`, `Spare Resolve Platform`
- **After:** `Spare Engage - Both Eligibility & Resolve`, `Spare Resolve`

#### Why This Matters
The previous package names were ambiguous. These new names clearly indicate whether the features within a package apply to just one product (Spare Resolve) or both (Spare Engage), making it easier for administrators to understand the scope of each feature flag.

### 🔍 Global Search (Superbox) Now Available Everywhere

**What's New**  
The Superbox global search bar can now be opened and used from within all areas of the platform, including Micro-Frontend Applications (MFEs) like Enterprise Asset Management.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- Any page within a Micro-Frontend, such as the *Enterprise Asset Management* app.

### 🔑 Faster Organization Access Requests for Super Admins

**What's New**  
When a Super Admin requests access to an organization, the "Administrator" role is now selected by default in the request form.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- The "Request Access" modal that appears when a Super Admin tries to access an organization they do not have permissions for.

#### What You Can Do
- Submit access requests more quickly, as the most common role ("Administrator") is pre-selected.
- You can still manually select a different role from the dropdown if needed.

#### Why This Matters
This streamlines the workflow for Super Admins by removing a repetitive step, as "Administrator" is the most frequently requested role.
</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **"Navigate to Organization" Button Now Works Correctly (SEC-69)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where the "Navigate to Organization" button in the access request approval modal would close the dialog but fail to switch to the target organization. The button now correctly navigates as expected.
- **Rider Creation with "Contact Only" Phone Numbers (ENG-1000)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed a bug that prevented creating a new rider from modals (e.g., when adding a rider to a new Case or Request) if their "Contact Only" phone number was already in use by another rider. This flow now works consistently with the main rider creation page.
- **Workflow Search Now Handles Multiple Words (ENG-1001)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue in *Settings > Workflows* where searching for a workflow using multiple words (e.g., "Rider Cancellation") would fail. The search now correctly handles spaces and returns the expected results.

### 🔑 Just-in-Time (JIT) Access Requests for Organizations

**What's New**  
A new self-serve system allows Spare employees (Super Admins) to request temporary, role-based access to customer organizations. This workflow includes justification, approvals, and automatic revocation, enhancing security and auditability.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- The organization selection page after login (*Select Organization*)
- *Super Admin > Organizations > (select an org) > 'Request Access' button*
- A new top-level *Access Requests* page in the sidebar

#### What You Can Do

- Designated approvers are notified to approve or deny the request.
- Track the status of your requests and see when access will expire.
- Manage all access requests and approval policies from the new "Access Requests" page.

#### Why This Matters
This replaces manual access grants with a structured, auditable, and time-bound system. It ensures that access to customer environments is granted on a need-to-know basis with the principle of least privilege, improving security and compliance.
</Accordion>

### 🔎 Make Address and Phone Number Custom Fields Searchable

**What's New**  
You can now enable searching on custom fields of type "Address" and "Phone Number". Previously, only Text, Number, and Date fields could be made searchable.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Field Manager > (select a field group) > (create or edit a custom field)*

#### What You Can Do
- When creating or editing a custom field for Riders or Requests, if you select the "Address" or "Phone Number" type, you can now check the "Searchable" box. This allows users to find riders or requests by searching for values in those fields.

#### Why This Matters
This expands search capabilities, making it easier for dispatchers and admins to locate records using important contact or location information stored in custom fields.

### 💳 Enhanced Stripe Configuration Validation

**What's New**  
The system now validates Stripe API keys when you save a Stripe payment provider configuration. It checks that the secret key is valid and that the publishable and secret keys are not mismatched (e.g., one Test key and one Live key).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Payment > Payment Providers > (creating or editing a Stripe provider)*

#### What You Can Do
- When you enter Stripe API keys, the system will prevent you from saving if the keys are invalid or if there's a mismatch between Live and Test environments, showing a specific error message.

#### Why This Matters
This prevents misconfigurations that could lead to payment processing failures. By catching errors during setup, it ensures that the payment integration is correctly configured before it's used.

### ✉️ Option to Skip Welcome Email for New Admins

**What's New**  
When creating a new administrator account via the API, you can now choose to skip sending the automated welcome email by using the `skipWelcomeEmail` parameter.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions to create new admins.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is an API-only enhancement available on the endpoint for creating administrators. It is not exposed in the admin user interface.

#### What You Can Do
- Programmatically create new admin accounts without triggering a welcome email.

#### Why This Matters
This is useful for scenarios like temporary Just-In-Time (JIT) access, where an employee is granted short-term admin rights and a welcome email is unnecessary. It helps reduce email clutter for internal or temporary accounts.
</Accordion>

---
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Driver/Dispatch Communication Service Stability (BUS-4356)**
  - _Resolution_: Restored a fallback mechanism for driver/dispatch communications. Systems that use this feature but do not have their own Twilio connection will now correctly use the platform's default service, preventing communication failures.

### 🔧 Configurable Read-Only External Rider IDs

**What's New**  
A new feature is available to make the `External Rider ID` field on a rider's profile read-only. This is designed for organizations where this ID is managed by an external system and should not be editable by agents in Spare Admin.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ReadOnlyExternalRiderIds` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *People > Riders > [Select a Rider]* (the `External Rider ID` field in the rider's profile details).

#### What You Can Do
- When this feature is enabled for your organization, the `External Rider ID` field will be visible but not editable, preventing accidental changes by staff.

#### Why This Matters
This ensures data integrity for rider IDs that are synced from an external source of truth, preventing discrepancies between systems.

### ⚙️ Just-in-Time (JIT) Access for Spare Employees (Super Admins)

**What's New**  
A new system has been implemented for Spare employees (Super Admins) to request temporary, time-bound access to customer organizations. This provides a formal, auditable workflow for granting access for support and configuration purposes. (Note: The user interface for this feature will be released separately).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is primarily a backend system that governs Super Admin access. The effects will be visible in audit logs and future administrative UIs.

#### What You Can Do

- Access is automatically revoked when the approved time expires.
- All requests and approvals are logged for a complete audit trail.

#### Why This Matters
This system enhances security and accountability by replacing persistent access with a "least privilege" model. It ensures that access to customer data is granted only when necessary, for a limited time, and with full transparency.
