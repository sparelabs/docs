### 📝 'Service Created' Event Added to Activity Logs

**What's New**  
A "Service created" event is now automatically logged in the activity feed whenever a new service is created, capturing a snapshot of its initial configuration.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Admin > Services > [Select a Service] > Activity Log* tab.

#### What You Can Do
- View a complete audit trail for services, starting from the moment of creation.
- See who created a service and when, along with all its initial settings.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, only updates to a service were logged, leaving a gap in the historical record. This change ensures a complete and transparent audit trail, making it easier to track the history of a service's configuration from the very beginning.

### 🛠️ Overhaul of the Service Configuration Page

**What's New**  
The page for managing services has been completely redesigned with a new tab-based layout and a clear separation between viewing and editing information. This new V2 interface is optional and can be enabled by each user in their personal settings.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ServiceViewV2` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- The new view is accessible from the *System > Services* page.
- Enable the new interface by navigating to *Your Profile Icon > Personal Settings* and changing the "Service View" setting to "Version 2".

#### What You Can Do
- Navigate through service settings using the new tabbed layout: `Overview`, `Zones & Stops`, `Booking`, `Windows & Engine`, and `Activity Log`.
- View a complete history of changes made to the service in the new `Activity Log` tab.
- Use an improved map-based editor for managing service areas and stops in the `Zones & Stops` tab.

#### Why This Matters
The previous single-page layout for service configuration was becoming crowded. The new tabbed interface organizes settings logically, making it much easier to find and configure specific aspects of a service.

### 🔄 Designate Riders and Drivers in Simulations

**What's New**  
When configuring a "Demo" type simulation, you can now designate specific riders and drivers who will be guaranteed to have a trip or duty scheduled every day the simulation is active.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *System > Simulations > (Create or Edit a Simulation)*
- When "Simulation Type" is set to "Demo", new fields for "Designated Demo Riders" and "Designated Demo Drivers" will appear.

#### What You Can Do
- Select one or more riders and drivers to be "designated" for a demo simulation.
- The system will prioritize creating requests and duties for these individuals each day before scheduling for the rest of the random pool.

#### Why This Matters
This feature is useful for creating consistent, repeatable demonstration scenarios. It ensures that key participants (e.g., a specific "VIP rider" or "main driver") are always present in the simulation, making demos more predictable and reliable.

### 👥 Team Member Schedule and Capability Management

**What's New**  
A new dedicated view for managing team members' schedules, capabilities, and activities is now available, providing a centralized hub for user administration.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access. To edit another user's profile, the `Update any Admin` (`PATCH_ANY_ADMIN`) permission is required.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *System > Team > (Select a Team Member)*
- This opens a new page with three tabs: `Activity`, `Capabilities`, and `Schedule`.

#### What You Can Do

- **Capabilities Tab:** View a user's authorization groups and, for Spare Engage, assign the "Appointment Types" they are qualified to handle.
- **Activity Tab:** View a log of the team member's recent activities within the system.

#### Why This Matters
This provides a single, organized place to manage all aspects of a team member's availability and qualifications. This is critical for features that depend on user availability, such as appointment booking and automated case assignment.

### 🔧 Targeted Optimization Service Setting

**What's New**  
An advanced setting for "Targeted Optimization" is now available in the service configuration interface.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access.
- No feature flags required (previously required `ShowTargetedOptimization` feature flag).

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Services > [Service Name] > Edit > Other* tab.

#### What You Can Do
- Access and configure the Targeted Optimization setting directly within the service settings UI.

#### Why This Matters

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access to manage Fleets

<Accordion title="See More">

### 🏷️ Renamed and Reorganized Feature Flag Packages

**What's New**  
The package names for feature flags related to Spare Engage (Resolve and Eligibility) have been updated in the Super Admin interface to be more descriptive. This is a cosmetic change to improve clarity and does not alter any feature functionality.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super Admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Super Admin > Organizations > [Select an Organization] > Feature Flags tab*

#### What You Can Do
- Observe the updated package names when managing feature flags for an organization.
- **Before:** `Spare Eligibility Platform`, `Spare Resolve Platform`
- **After:** `Spare Engage - Both Eligibility & Resolve`, `Spare Resolve`

#### Why This Matters
The previous package names were ambiguous. These new names clearly indicate whether the features within a package apply to just one product (Spare Resolve) or both (Spare Engage), making it easier for administrators to understand the scope of each feature flag.

### 🔍 Global Search (Superbox) Now Available Everywhere

**What's New**

### 🔑 Faster Organization Access Requests for Super Admins

**What's New**  
When a Super Admin requests access to an organization, the "Administrator" role is now selected by default in the request form.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- The "Request Access" modal that appears when a Super Admin tries to access an organization they do not have permissions for.

#### What You Can Do
- Submit access requests more quickly, as the most common role ("Administrator") is pre-selected.
- You can still manually select a different role from the dropdown if needed.

#### Why This Matters
This streamlines the workflow for Super Admins by removing a repetitive step, as "Administrator" is the most frequently requested role.
</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **"Navigate to Organization" Button Now Works Correctly (SEC-69)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where the "Navigate to Organization" button in the access request approval modal would close the dialog but fail to switch to the target organization. The button now correctly navigates as expected.
- **Rider Creation with "Contact Only" Phone Numbers (ENG-1000)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed a bug that prevented creating a new rider from modals (e.g., when adding a rider to a new Case or Request) if their "Contact Only" phone number was already in use by another rider. This flow now works consistently with the main rider creation page.
- **Workflow Search Now Handles Multiple Words (ENG-1001)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue in *Settings > Workflows* where searching for a workflow using multiple words (e.g., "Rider Cancellation") would fail. The search now correctly handles spaces and returns the expected results.

### 🔑 Just-in-Time (JIT) Access Requests for Organizations

**What's New**  
A new self-serve system allows Spare employees (Super Admins) to request temporary, role-based access to customer organizations. This workflow includes justification, approvals, and automatic revocation, enhancing security and auditability.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Why This Matters
This replaces manual access grants with a structured, auditable, and time-bound system. It ensures that access to customer environments is granted on a need-to-know basis with the principle of least privilege, improving security and compliance.
</Accordion>

### 🔎 Make Address and Phone Number Custom Fields Searchable

**What's New**  
You can now enable searching on custom fields of type "Address" and "Phone Number". Previously, only Text, Number, and Date fields could be made searchable.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Field Manager > (select a field group) > (create or edit a custom field)*

### 💳 Enhanced Stripe Configuration Validation

**What's New**  
The system now validates Stripe API keys when you save a Stripe payment provider configuration. It checks that the secret key is valid and that the publishable and secret keys are not mismatched (e.g., one Test key and one Live key).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Payment > Payment Providers > (creating or editing a Stripe provider)*

#### What You Can Do
- When you enter Stripe API keys, the system will prevent you from saving if the keys are invalid or if there's a mismatch between Live and Test environments, showing a specific error message.

#### Why This Matters
This prevents misconfigurations that could lead to payment processing failures. By catching errors during setup, it ensures that the payment integration is correctly configured before it's used.

### ✉️ Option to Skip Welcome Email for New Admins

**What's New**  
When creating a new administrator account via the API, you can now choose to skip sending the automated welcome email by using the `skipWelcomeEmail` parameter.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions to create new admins.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is an API-only enhancement available on the endpoint for creating administrators. It is not exposed in the admin user interface.

#### What You Can Do
- Programmatically create new admin accounts without triggering a welcome email.

#### Why This Matters
This is useful for scenarios like temporary Just-In-Time (JIT) access, where an employee is granted short-term admin rights and a welcome email is unnecessary. It helps reduce email clutter for internal or temporary accounts.
</Accordion>

---
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Driver/Dispatch Communication Service Stability (BUS-4356)**
  - _Resolution_: Restored a fallback mechanism for driver/dispatch communications. Systems that use this feature but do not have their own Twilio connection will now correctly use the platform's default service, preventing communication failures.

### 🔧 Configurable Read-Only External Rider IDs

**What's New**  
A new feature is available to make the `External Rider ID` field on a rider's profile read-only. This is designed for organizations where this ID is managed by an external system and should not be editable by agents in Spare Admin.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ReadOnlyExternalRiderIds` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *People > Riders > [Select a Rider]* (the `External Rider ID` field in the rider's profile details).

### ⚙️ Just-in-Time (JIT) Access for Spare Employees (Super Admins)

**What's New**  
A new system has been implemented for Spare employees (Super Admins) to request temporary, time-bound access to customer organizations. This provides a formal, auditable workflow for granting access for support and configuration purposes. (Note: The user interface for this feature will be released separately).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is primarily a backend system that governs Super Admin access. The effects will be visible in audit logs and future administrative UIs.

#### What You Can Do
- Spare employees can request access to an organization for a specific duration and with a clear justification.
- Access is automatically revoked when the approved time expires.
- All requests and approvals are logged for a complete audit trail.

#### Why This Matters
This system enhances security and accountability by replacing persistent access with a "least privilege" model. It ensures that access to customer data is granted only when necessary, for a limited time, and with full transparency.
