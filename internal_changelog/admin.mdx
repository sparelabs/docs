### 🗺️ Set Favorite Location with an Interactive Map

**What's New**  
When adding or editing a rider's favorite location, you can now use an interactive map to precisely set the address coordinates. This allows for fine-tuning the location pin, which is especially useful for large venues like malls or airports.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Riders > Rider List > [Select a Rider] > Favorite Locations* (in the "Add Favorite Location" or "Edit Favorite Location" modal)

#### What You Can Do
- Search for an address as usual. A map will appear showing the location.
- Drag the pin on the map to adjust the exact pickup or drop-off spot. The address field will update automatically based on the new pin location.

#### Why This Matters
Address search doesn't always place the pin in the most convenient spot for riders, especially in large areas. This feature gives admins the ability to manually adjust the location to a specific entrance or pickup point, improving accuracy and the rider's experience.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Rider Import with Duplicate Phone Numbers (BUS-4733)**
  * _Resolution_: The rider import process (*Data > Riders > Import Riders*) will now correctly allow multiple riders to have the same phone number, as long as the organization setting "Use phone number for authentication" is disabled. This aligns the import validation with the platform's overall authentication rules.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Manage Own Notification Settings (BUS-4729)**

### 📋 Copy Organization Settings on Creation

**What's New**  
When creating a new organization, you can now use the **"Copy From Organization"** feature to pre-populate its settings from an existing organization. This tool allows you to select a source organization from any region to use as a template.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Super Admin > Organizations > Add Organization*: A new **"Copy From Organization"** button is available at the top of the creation form.

#### What You Can Do
- Click the **"Copy From Organization"** button to open a modal.
- In the modal, first select a region, then search for and select the source organization you want to copy settings from.
- After confirming, the new organization form will be pre-filled with settings from the source, including basic settings (currency, timezone, etc.), feature flags, driver login configurations, and more.

#### Why This Matters
Setting up a new organization with complex configurations can be time-consuming and prone to error. This feature drastically speeds up the process and ensures consistency by allowing you to replicate a known-good configuration from an existing organization.

### 🗺️ Interactive Detour Visualization for Services

**What's New**  
The Service configuration page now includes an interactive visualization that shows how detour settings affect travel times. This tool provides a clear, graphical representation of pickup and dropoff flexibility, making it easier to understand and configure complex service parameters.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Services > [Service] > Engine*: The new **Detour Visualization** appears alongside the detour configuration fields.

#### What You Can Do
- **Visualize time windows:** The chart displays bars representing direct travel time, maximum detour time, and pickup/dropoff windows.
- **Interact with sliders:** As you adjust sliders for fields like "Maximum detour per trip" or "Maximum time from request to pickup," the visualization updates in real-time to show the impact.
- **Highlight related fields:** Hovering over a field in the form will highlight the corresponding element in the visualization, and vice-versa.

#### Why This Matters
Detour settings are powerful but can be abstract and difficult to conceptualize. This visualization provides immediate, intuitive feedback on how your changes will impact the rider experience, leading to more accurate and intentional service design.

### 🗣️ New "AI Voice & Chat" Settings Section

**What's New**  
AI-related settings have been moved from the "Advanced" menu into a new, dedicated **"AI Voice & Chat"** section in the main settings sidebar. This makes it easier to find and manage all configurations for AI Voice and Chat in one place.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- The section appears if at least one of the following feature flags is enabled: `LaunchAIVoice`, `EngageAIVoice`, or `AIVoiceOutboundCalls`.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings*: A new **"AI Voice & Chat"** menu item is now present in the sidebar, located below "Enterprise Asset Management".

#### What You Can Do
- **Access AI settings:** Navigate to the new section to find all AI-related configuration pages that were previously under the "Advanced" menu.
- **Find settings easily:** This section consolidates links to pages like **Agent**, **Agent Forwarding Hours**, **AI Voice Exclusions**, and **Outbound AI Call Configurations**.

#### Why This Matters
As our AI capabilities expand, they deserve a distinct and easy-to-find home. This reorganization declutters the "Advanced" settings menu and provides a logical, centralized location for all current and future AI configurations.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Correct Start Date for "Today" in Group Memberships (ENG-1120)**
  - _Resolution_: Corrected an issue where creating a group membership with a start date of "Today" would store a `null` value. The system now correctly saves the current timestamp, ensuring the start date appears correctly in features like letter templates.

</Update>

### 📝 Improved Form and Custom Field Configuration

**What's New**  
We've introduced several quality-of-life improvements for managing custom fields and forms. You can now reorder choice options via drag-and-drop, edit the labels of existing choices without changing their underlying value, and quickly identify required fields in your forms with a new "Required" indicator.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- **Choice Reordering & Editing**: *Settings > Field Manager > [Select a Single/Multiple Choice Field]* (in the "Choices" section). This also applies to choice-based fields within the Engage form builder at *Engage > Case Types > [Select Case Type] > Forms*.
- **Required Indicator**: *Engage > Case Types > [Select Case Type] > Forms* (in the list of fields within the form builder, next to the visibility text).

#### What You Can Do
- **Reorder Choices**: When configuring a "Single Choice" or "Multiple Choice" custom field, use the new drag handle (grip-lines icon) to the left of each option to change its display order.
- **Edit Choice Labels**: Click the new pencil icon next to a choice option to edit its public-facing label. The underlying value/key remains read-only to ensure data integrity.
- **Identify Required Fields**: When viewing fields in the form builder, a "Required" indicator now appears next to the visibility text (e.g., "Editable and visible to Riders · Required"), making it easy to see which fields are mandatory at a glance.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, managing choice-based custom fields was rigid; reordering options required deleting and re-creating them, and labels couldn't be edited. These updates make form and custom field management more flexible and intuitive, saving administrators significant time and effort.
</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Corrected Case Type Migration Failures (ENG-1089, ENG-1098)**
  - *Resolution*: Fixed an issue where the Data Migration Tool (DMT) would fail when copying a case type if the source organization had a "todo" status that didn't exist in the destination. The tool now correctly skips attempting to create these system-generated statuses, allowing the migration to complete successfully for all other statuses.

### 🔐 Granular SQL Editor Access

**What's New**  
A new, specific permission is now available to grant non-super-admins access to the SQL Editor in Analytics. This allows organizations to provide advanced query capabilities to trusted users without granting full super-admin privileges.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access to assign roles and permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Admin > Roles* (a new `SQL Editor` permission is available under the `Analytics` section)
- *Analytics > SQL Editor* (now accessible to users with the new permission, previously super-admin only)

#### What You Can Do
- Create or edit a role to include the new `SQL Editor` permission.
- Assign this role to non-super-admin users, who can then navigate to the *Analytics > SQL Editor* page to write and run custom SQL queries.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, access to the powerful SQL Editor was restricted to super-admins. This change allows for more flexible and secure delegation of data analysis tasks to team members who need direct database access for complex reporting.

### 🧾 Uzurv Ride Receipts in OpenFleet

**What's New**  
For OpenFleet trips dispatched through Uzurv, a detailed ride receipt is now available in the request details panel after the trip is completed. This provides a full breakdown of the final fare.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `OpenFleet` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Operations > Requests > [Select a completed Uzurv-fleeted request] > Fleet tab*

#### What You Can Do
- After an Uzurv trip is completed, navigate to the 'Fleet' tab in the request's detail panel.
- A new 'Receipt' section will be visible, showing the final fare, distance traveled, trip duration, and an itemized list of fare components (e.g., base fare, per-mile charge).

#### Why This Matters
Previously, final fare details for Uzurv trips were not visible within the Spare platform. This integration provides transparency and simplifies reconciliation by displaying a complete, itemized receipt directly on the associated request.
</Accordion>

---
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Service Configuration Display**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue in the *Admin > Services* (V2) interface where associated Groups and Fare Rules were not displaying correctly when viewing a service's configuration. These details now appear as expected in view mode.
- **Trip Broker Integration Payment Handling (MOT-2674)**
  - _Resolution_: Resolved an issue in the Trip Broker (Trapeze) integration where trip updates could fail if a booking contained multiple riders with different payment types. The system now correctly identifies the primary rider's payment method to ensure updates are processed successfully.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `OrganizationSwitcherPopover` feature flag.
- Requires a user account with access to multiple organizations.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- In the header of micro-frontend applications, such as the *Enterprise Asset Management* app.

### 🏷️ Renamed and Reorganized Feature Flag Packages

**What's New**  
The package names for feature flags related to Spare Engage (Resolve and Eligibility) have been updated in the Super Admin interface to be more descriptive. This is a cosmetic change to improve clarity and does not alter any feature functionality.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **"Navigate to Organization" Button Now Works Correctly (SEC-69)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where the "Navigate to Organization" button in the access request approval modal would close the dialog but fail to switch to the target organization. The button now correctly navigates as expected.
- **Rider Creation with "Contact Only" Phone Numbers (ENG-1000)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed a bug that prevented creating a new rider from modals (e.g., when adding a rider to a new Case or Request) if their "Contact Only" phone number was already in use by another rider. This flow now works consistently with the main rider creation page.
- **Workflow Search Now Handles Multiple Words (ENG-1001)**

### 🔧 Configurable Read-Only External Rider IDs

**What's New**  
A new feature is available to make the `External Rider ID` field on a rider's profile read-only. This is designed for organizations where this ID is managed by an external system and should not be editable by agents in Spare Admin.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ReadOnlyExternalRiderIds` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *People > Riders > [Select a Rider]* (the `External Rider ID` field in the rider's profile details).

#### What You Can Do

### ⚙️ Just-in-Time (JIT) Access for Spare Employees (Super Admins)

**What's New**  
A new system has been implemented for Spare employees (Super Admins) to request temporary, time-bound access to customer organizations. This provides a formal, auditable workflow for granting access for support and configuration purposes. (Note: The user interface for this feature will be released separately).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is primarily a backend system that governs Super Admin access. The effects will be visible in audit logs and future administrative UIs.

#### What You Can Do
