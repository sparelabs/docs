### ⚙️ Manage AI Voice Rider Exclusions

**What's New**  
You can now manage a list of specific riders who will be excluded from interacting with AI Voice. Calls from these riders will be routed directly to a human agent.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access and the `AI Voice Exclusions > List` permission. This page is only visible if AI Voice is enabled for your organization.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Advanced > AI Voice Exclusions*

#### What You Can Do
- Add riders to the exclusion list using a search-and-select field.
- View and remove any existing riders from the exclusion list.

#### Why This Matters
This feature gives you direct control to ensure specific riders, such as those who require special assistance or have expressed a preference to speak with a person, can always bypass the automated system and connect directly with your staff.

### 🚫 Exclude Specific Riders from AI Voice

**What's New**  
You can now create and manage an exclusion list of riders who will bypass AI Voice and be forwarded directly to a human agent when they call in. This is ideal for riders who require special assistance or have been identified as needing to speak with dispatch immediately.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with permissions to manage AI Voice Exclusions (`ManageAiVoiceExclusions`)

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- A new configuration page for managing AI Voice exclusions is available in your communication settings.

#### What You Can Do
- Add riders to an exclusion list by their Rider ID.
- When a rider on this list calls a phone number associated with an AI Voice agent, the system recognizes them and immediately forwards the call to the configured transfer number, skipping the AI conversation entirely.

#### Why This Matters
While AI Voice streamlines many interactions, some riders may always need to speak to a person. This feature provides the flexibility to define those exceptions, ensuring a better experience for specific riders while maintaining the efficiency of AI Voice for the majority of calls.

### 👤 Anonymous Access for AI Agents

**What's New**  
A new "None" authentication type is available for AI Voice and AI Chat agents. This allows conversations to be initiated without requiring the system to identify the user first, enabling support for unauthenticated callers or chat users.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *AI > Agents > New/Edit Agent* (new "None" option in the "Authentication" dropdown)

#### What You Can Do
- Configure an agent to not require user authentication by selecting the "None" authentication type.
- The system will automatically prevent you from assigning capabilities that require an authenticated user (e.g., "Book a trip") to an agent with "None" authentication.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, all AI agents required the user to be identified through their phone number or another method. This new option provides flexibility for use cases where the user is unknown or does not have a profile, such as providing general information to the public.

### 🗣️ Smarter Accessibility Questions in AI Voice

**What's New**  
AI Voice will now only ask callers about accessibility needs if there are services available for their trip that actually offer accessibility features. This streamlines the booking conversation by avoiding unnecessary questions.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This change affects the conversation flow during a trip booking via AI Voice. There is no UI component in the admin platform.

#### What You Can Do
- Riders calling to book a trip will experience a more concise conversation if no accessibility options are available for their journey.

#### Why This Matters
Asking about accessibility needs when no accessible options are available can be confusing for riders. This change makes the AI Voice interaction more intelligent and context-aware, improving the booking experience.
