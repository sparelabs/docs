### 🗣️ Smarter Accessibility Questions in AI Voice

**What's New**  
AI Voice will now only ask callers about accessibility needs if there are services available for their trip that actually offer accessibility features. This streamlines the booking conversation by avoiding unnecessary questions.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required.

#### Where You'll See It
- This change affects the conversation flow during a trip booking via AI Voice. There is no UI component in the admin platform.

#### What You Can Do
- Riders calling to book a trip will experience a more concise conversation if no accessibility options are available for their journey.

#### Why This Matters
Asking about accessibility needs when no accessible options are available can be confusing for riders. This change makes the AI Voice interaction more intelligent and context-aware, improving the booking experience.
