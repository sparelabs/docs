### 🗣️ More Robust Address Confirmation

**What's New**  
AI Voice now uses an improved prompt and logic to confirm addresses with callers. To ensure accuracy, it will now explicitly read back the full address for confirmation before proceeding with a booking.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LaunchAIVoice` feature flag.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is an improvement to the conversation flow during a call with AI Voice when a rider is booking a trip to a new address.

#### What You Can Do
- When a rider provides an address, AI Voice will confirm it by stating the full address (e.g., "123 Main Street, Anytown, Anystate") instead of a simplified version.
- This gives the rider a clear opportunity to catch any errors in how the address was understood before the trip is booked.

#### Why This Matters
Inaccurate address capture is a key source of booking errors and rider frustration. This change makes the confirmation step more explicit and thorough, reducing the likelihood of trips being booked to the wrong location.
</Accordion>

---
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **AI Voice Conversation Export Labels (AIP-767)**

### 🤖 Improved Booking Confirmation in AI Voice

**What's New**  
AI Voice has been updated to more reliably ask for confirmation from the rider before finalizing a trip booking. This enhancement reduces the likelihood of unintentional bookings.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LaunchAIVoice` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a behavioral change within the AI Voice phone call flow when a rider is booking a trip.

You can now create and manage an exclusion list of riders who will bypass AI Voice and be forwarded directly to a human agent when they call in. This is ideal for riders who require special assistance or have been identified as needing to speak with dispatch immediately.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with permissions to manage AI Voice Exclusions (`ManageAiVoiceExclusions`)

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- A new configuration page for managing AI Voice exclusions is available in your communication settings.

#### What You Can Do
- Add riders to an exclusion list by their Rider ID.
- When a rider on this list calls a phone number associated with an AI Voice agent, the system recognizes them and immediately forwards the call to the configured transfer number, skipping the AI conversation entirely.

#### Why This Matters
While AI Voice streamlines many interactions, some riders may always need to speak to a person. This feature provides the flexibility to define those exceptions, ensuring a better experience for specific riders while maintaining the efficiency of AI Voice for the majority of calls.

### 👤 Anonymous Access for AI Agents

**What's New**  
A new "None" authentication type is available for AI Voice and AI Chat agents. This allows conversations to be initiated without requiring the system to identify the user first, enabling support for unauthenticated callers or chat users.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *AI > Agents > New/Edit Agent* (new "None" option in the "Authentication" dropdown)

#### What You Can Do
- Configure an agent to not require user authentication by selecting the "None" authentication type.
- The system will automatically prevent you from assigning capabilities that require an authenticated user (e.g., "Book a trip") to an agent with "None" authentication.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, all AI agents required the user to be identified through their phone number or another method. This new option provides flexibility for use cases where the user is unknown or does not have a profile, such as providing general information to the public.

### 🗣️ Smarter Accessibility Questions in AI Voice

**What's New**  
AI Voice will now only ask callers about accessibility needs if there are services available for their trip that actually offer accessibility features. This streamlines the booking conversation by avoiding unnecessary questions.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This change affects the conversation flow during a trip booking via AI Voice. There is no UI component in the admin platform.

#### What You Can Do
- Riders calling to book a trip will experience a more concise conversation if no accessibility options are available for their journey.

#### Why This Matters
Asking about accessibility needs when no accessible options are available can be confusing for riders. This change makes the AI Voice interaction more intelligent and context-aware, improving the booking experience.
