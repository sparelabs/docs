### 💬 View AI Voice Conversations

**What's New**  
A new "AI Voice Conversations" page is now accessible from the settings menu, providing a centralized place to review and analyze call transcripts and data from the AI Voice system.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LaunchAIVoice` feature flag.
- Requires Admin access with the `GET_ANY_AI_VOICE_CONVERSATION` permission.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > AI Agent > AI Voice* (new "View Conversations" link)
- This link navigates to the new page at `/admin/launch/aiVoiceConversations`.

#### What You Can Do
- Navigate directly from the AI Voice settings to a dedicated page listing all AI-handled phone conversations.
- View a list of conversations with key details to identify specific calls for review.

#### Why This Matters

### 📞 SIP Trunking Support for AI Voice

**What's New**  
AI Voice now supports receiving inbound calls via a direct SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunk connection. This provides a flexible alternative to using Twilio Programmable Voice for connecting your phone system to Spare's AI agents.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LaunchAIVoice` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a backend capability that is configured in your telephony provider (e.g., Twilio) and affects how AI Voice agents are set up. There is no direct UI in Spare Admin for this.

#### What You Can Do
- Configure your phone numbers to use a SIP trunk to route calls directly to AI Voice.
- The system automatically detects SIP-based calls to handle functions like call transfers and recording retrieval correctly without requiring different agent configurations.

#### Why This Matters
This provides greater flexibility for integrating AI Voice with existing enterprise telephony systems. It can help simplify call routing architecture and potentially reduce telecommunications costs by allowing the use of existing SIP infrastructure.

### 📅 Improved Date Recognition for Rider Authentication

**What's New**  
AI Voice now more accurately understands and validates dates provided by riders during authentication, such as a date of birth. The system has been improved to better handle different spoken date formats and identify ambiguous inputs.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to the AI Voice platform.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Why This Matters
This enhancement reduces authentication failures caused by the system misinterpreting a rider's spoken date. It leads to a smoother, more reliable experience for callers and increases the success rate of automated authentication.

### ⏱️ Configurable Pause for AI Voice Inbound Calls

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - Customer Specific Configuration' and is not yet ready for customer use. Reach out to the Product team with questions.</Warning>

**What's New**  
For specific AI Voice call forwarding workflows, the initial pause before the call connects has been reduced. A new feature flag also allows this pause to be skipped entirely for applicable organizations.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `PstaAiVoiceSkipInboundPause` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a backend change affecting the rider's calling experience for certain inbound AI Voice numbers.

#### Why This Matters
Long pauses can lead to rider confusion or abandoned calls. This change shortens the connection time, creating a smoother and more responsive experience for riders using AI Voice.

### 🗣️ Norwegian Language Support for AI Voice

**What's New**  
AI Voice now supports Norwegian (`no-NO`). You can configure agents to interact with callers in Norwegian, with localized prompts and improved understanding of Norwegian language patterns.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LaunchAIVoice` feature flag and Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Admin > AI Voice > Agents > (Select an agent) > Edit Agent* (in the "Language" dropdown)
- *Admin > AI Voice > Agents > Add Agent* (in the "Language" dropdown)

#### What You Can Do
- Select "Norwegian" from the "Language" dropdown when creating or editing an AI Voice agent. The agent will then use Norwegian for all voice interactions with callers.

#### Why This Matters
This expansion allows agencies in Norway to provide automated, localized support to their riders via AI Voice. This improves accessibility and provides a better customer experience for Norwegian-speaking callers.

### 📞 Schedule-Specific Call Forwarding Numbers

**What's New**  
You can now set a unique call forwarding phone number for each "Forwarding Hours" time rule. If a specific number isn't set for a rule, calls will be routed to the agent's default forwarding number.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LaunchAIVoice` feature flag and Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Admin > AI Voice > Agents > (Select an agent) > Forwarding Hours*

#### What You Can Do
- When creating or editing a "Regular Hours" or "Special Hours" rule, a new optional "Forwarding Number" field is available.
- You can enter a specific phone number for that time period. If left blank, the system uses the main forwarding number configured for the agent.
- The list of rules now includes a "Forwarding Number" column to show which number is assigned to each rule, or "Same as agent" if none is specified.

#### Why This Matters
This provides greater flexibility for call routing. For example, you can now forward calls to a different dispatch center during weekends, to an after-hours answering service overnight, or to a specific manager during holidays, all from within the same agent configuration.
</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Japanese AI Voice Prompts (AIP-598)**

### 📞 Granular Call Forwarding by Time of Day

**What's New**  
AI Voice now supports assigning specific forwarding phone numbers to different time rules within an agent's Forwarding Hours. This allows calls to be routed to different teams or locations based on the time of day, day of the week, or for specific date overrides like holidays.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LaunchAIVoice` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Admin > AI & Messaging > Voice Agents > [Select Agent] > Forwarding Hours tab* (a new "Forwarding Number" field is now available for each time rule and override)

#### What You Can Do
- Enter a unique phone number for each scheduled time rule (e.g., weekday business hours) and for each override (e.g., holidays).
- If a time rule is active but does not have a specific number assigned, the system will fall back to using the main forwarding number set for the agent.
- If no number is set for the active rule or the agent, the call will not be forwarded.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, an AI Voice agent could only forward to a single, static phone number. This change provides the flexibility to route rider calls to the correct destination—such as an after-hours call center, a specific department during business hours, or a holiday support line—automatically based on your defined schedules.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Multilingual AI Voice Introductory Message (AIP-641)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where AI Voice agents configured for multiple languages would play a repetitive introductory greeting (e.g., English followed by Spanish). The agent will now deliver a single, clear greeting in the primary language before handling conversations in multiple languages.

### ⚙️ Manage AI Voice Rider Exclusions

**What's New**  
You can now manage a list of specific riders who will be excluded from interacting with AI Voice. Calls from these riders will be routed directly to a human agent.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access and the `AI Voice Exclusions > List` permission. This page is only visible if AI Voice is enabled for your organization.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Advanced > AI Voice Exclusions*

#### What You Can Do
- Add riders to the exclusion list using a search-and-select field.
- View and remove any existing riders from the exclusion list.

#### Why This Matters

### 🚫 Exclude Specific Riders from AI Voice

**What's New**  
You can now create and manage an exclusion list of riders who will bypass AI Voice and be forwarded directly to a human agent when they call in. This is ideal for riders who require special assistance or have been identified as needing to speak with dispatch immediately.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with permissions to manage AI Voice Exclusions (`ManageAiVoiceExclusions`)

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- A new configuration page for managing AI Voice exclusions is available in your communication settings.

#### What You Can Do
- Add riders to an exclusion list by their Rider ID.
- When a rider on this list calls a phone number associated with an AI Voice agent, the system recognizes them and immediately forwards the call to the configured transfer number, skipping the AI conversation entirely.

#### Why This Matters
While AI Voice streamlines many interactions, some riders may always need to speak to a person. This feature provides the flexibility to define those exceptions, ensuring a better experience for specific riders while maintaining the efficiency of AI Voice for the majority of calls.

### 👤 Anonymous Access for AI Agents

**What's New**  
A new "None" authentication type is available for AI Voice and AI Chat agents. This allows conversations to be initiated without requiring the system to identify the user first, enabling support for unauthenticated callers or chat users.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *AI > Agents > New/Edit Agent* (new "None" option in the "Authentication" dropdown)

#### What You Can Do
- Configure an agent to not require user authentication by selecting the "None" authentication type.
- The system will automatically prevent you from assigning capabilities that require an authenticated user (e.g., "Book a trip") to an agent with "None" authentication.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, all AI agents required the user to be identified through their phone number or another method. This new option provides flexibility for use cases where the user is unknown or does not have a profile, such as providing general information to the public.

### 🗣️ Smarter Accessibility Questions in AI Voice

**What's New**  
AI Voice will now only ask callers about accessibility needs if there are services available for their trip that actually offer accessibility features. This streamlines the booking conversation by avoiding unnecessary questions.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This change affects the conversation flow during a trip booking via AI Voice. There is no UI component in the admin platform.

#### What You Can Do
- Riders calling to book a trip will experience a more concise conversation if no accessibility options are available for their journey.

#### Why This Matters
Asking about accessibility needs when no accessible options are available can be confusing for riders. This change makes the AI Voice interaction more intelligent and context-aware, improving the booking experience.
