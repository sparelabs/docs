### 👤 Anonymous Access for AI Agents

**What's New**  
A new "None" authentication type is available for AI Voice and AI Chat agents. This allows conversations to be initiated without requiring the system to identify the user first, enabling support for unauthenticated callers or chat users.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *AI > Agents > New/Edit Agent* (new "None" option in the "Authentication" dropdown)

#### What You Can Do
- Configure an agent to not require user authentication by selecting the "None" authentication type.
- The system will automatically prevent you from assigning capabilities that require an authenticated user (e.g., "Book a trip") to an agent with "None" authentication.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, all AI agents required the user to be identified through their phone number or another method. This new option provides flexibility for use cases where the user is unknown or does not have a profile, such as providing general information to the public.

### 🗣️ Smarter Accessibility Questions in AI Voice

**What's New**  
AI Voice will now only ask callers about accessibility needs if there are services available for their trip that actually offer accessibility features. This streamlines the booking conversation by avoiding unnecessary questions.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This change affects the conversation flow during a trip booking via AI Voice. There is no UI component in the admin platform.

#### What You Can Do
- Riders calling to book a trip will experience a more concise conversation if no accessibility options are available for their journey.

#### Why This Matters
Asking about accessibility needs when no accessible options are available can be confusing for riders. This change makes the AI Voice interaction more intelligent and context-aware, improving the booking experience.
