### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Correct Default Form in Shared Case Links (ENG-1402)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where the "Share New Case Link" action in *Eligibility > Cases* would always link to the first available form instead of the one configured as the default. The link now correctly directs applicants to the form set as the default for that Case Type.

- **PDF Letter Generation Failures (ENG-1417)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed a backend issue that caused PDF generation for eligibility letters to fail due to a missing font file. Letters can now be generated successfully without error.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Appointment Conflict Detection (ENG-1200, ENG-970)**
  * _Resolution_: Implemented conflict detection to prevent double-booking appointments for the same time slot and assessor. If two users attempt to book the same slot concurrently, the second attempt will now be rejected with a conflict error, preventing duplicate appointments from being created.

### 👥 Manage Rider Representatives in Eligibility

**What's New**  
The "Representatives" management page is now available within the Eligibility product. This allows administrators to manage individuals who can act on behalf of riders, directly within the Eligibility workflow.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `RiderRepresentatives` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Eligibility Product > Users > Representatives* (new link in the sidebar)

#### What You Can Do
- Access a dedicated page to create, view, edit, and manage rider representatives specifically for your Eligibility programs.
- This functionality mirrors the existing representative management page in the Launch product.

#### Why This Matters
This change provides a consistent and unified experience for managing representatives across different Spare products, centralizing user management workflows and reducing the need to switch between products for related tasks.

### 🔐 Expanded Deadline Management Permissions

**What's New**  
Users with standard "Access to Engage" or "Access to Resolve" roles can now create, edit, and delete Deadline Definitions. Previously, these roles only had read-only access to deadlines.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Resolve Product > Settings > Deadlines*
- *Eligibility Product > Settings > Deadlines*

#### What You Can Do
- Users with the appropriate role can now fully manage the lifecycle of deadline definitions for cases without needing higher-level administrator permissions. This includes creating new deadlines, modifying existing ones, and removing those that are no longer needed.

#### Why This Matters
This change empowers team members to manage case resolution timelines directly, streamlining workflow configuration and reducing reliance on system administrators for routine adjustments.

### ✉️ Include Upcoming Group Memberships in Letter Variables

**What's New**  
You can now use new letter variables in Spare Engage that pull data from a rider's "Upcoming" group memberships, in addition to their "Active" ones. This is ideal for sending renewal notices or eligibility letters that need to reference future membership periods.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with Engage permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Engage > Letters > [Select a Template]* (in the "Insert Variable" picker)

#### What You Can Do
- When editing a letter template, you will see new variables with an "(Including Upcoming)" suffix (e.g., `{{groupIncludingUpcoming.{groupId}.expiryTs}}`).
- These variables will use data from the most recently created membership for a given group, whether it is Active or Upcoming.
- **Example:** If a rider has an active membership expiring in Feb 2026 and an upcoming membership expiring in Feb 2027, this new variable will correctly display the 2027 expiry date.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, letter variables could only see active memberships, making it impossible to reference future eligibility periods. This change ensures you can communicate accurate, forward-looking information to riders about their upcoming memberships.

### 🔍 Filter Cases by Connected Appointments and Letters

**What's New**  
Case list views in Spare Engage can now be filtered by their connected items, such as Appointments and Letters. This allows you to create powerful, specific views like "cases with appointments in the next 7 days" or "cases with a specific letter template sent this month."

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access with Engage permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Engage > Eligibility > [Case Type]* (Filter dropdown)
- *Engage > Resolve > [Case Type]* (Filter dropdown)

#### What You Can Do
- In the filter dropdown on a case list, you will see new filter options with "Appt:" and "Letter:" prefixes if the case type has appointments or letters configured.
- **Appointment Filters:** Filter by Type, Status, Assigned To, Start Time, End Time, and Created At.
- **Letter Filters:** Filter by Template, Generated At, and Sent At.
- Save these filters as part of a custom view for easy access.

#### Why This Matters
Finding cases based on their related activities used to be impossible. This feature gives you the tools to quickly locate cases based on the status and timing of their associated appointments and communications, streamlining workflows for agents and managers.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Appointment Extra Availability (ENG-1108)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where "Extra Availability" for appointments was not being split into correct time slots and booking attempts were failing. An admin's extra availability is now correctly handled, allowing appointments to be successfully booked during those times.
