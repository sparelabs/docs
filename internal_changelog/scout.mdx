### 🤖 Improved Scout Template Matching

**What's New**  
Scout is now significantly better at understanding your natural language questions and matching them to pre-built report templates. This results in more accurate and relevant analytics charts generated from your queries.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access and the Analytics V2 module.

#### Where You'll See It
- *AI > Scout* (when you ask a question that could be answered by an existing report template).

#### What You Can Do
- Ask questions like "What percentage of our rides were booked by AI Voice?" and have Scout reliably find and use the correct report template to generate the answer.
- Get more accurate results from Scout, as it now has an improved ability to handle synonyms and understand the intent behind your query.

#### Why This Matters
This enhancement helps you get the exact report you need more reliably, without needing to know the specific terminology or structure of the underlying data cubes, making Scout a more powerful and intuitive analytics tool.
