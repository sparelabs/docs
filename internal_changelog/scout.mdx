### 📊 Scout AI Query Results Capped at 1,000 Rows

**What's New**  
To improve performance and prevent browser issues, analytics queries generated by the Scout AI assistant are now limited to a maximum of 1,000 rows.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `Scout` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Scout AI Assistant* (when asking for analytics data that returns a table)

#### What You Can Do
- If you ask for a query that would return more than 1,000 rows (e.g., "show me all trips from last year"), the results will be automatically capped at 1,000.
- If you ask for a specific number below 1,000 (e.g., "show me the top 10 drivers"), that limit will be respected.

#### Why This Matters
Requesting extremely large datasets could cause the Admin portal to become slow or unresponsive. This limit ensures a stable and performant experience when using the Scout AI for data analysis.

### 🧠 Scout AI Understands More Transit and Case Management Terms

**What's New**  
Scout AI's internal glossary has been expanded with over 70 new terms related to public transit and Spare Engage (case management). This enhances the AI's ability to understand natural language questions and generate more accurate analytics queries.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires the AI Product to be enabled or Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Scout > Chat*

#### What You Can Do
- Ask Scout questions using more specific terminology related to case management (e.g., "Case Priority", "Case Status") or general transit concepts (e.g., "Headway", "Layover", "Deadhead").

#### Why This Matters
A broader vocabulary allows Scout to better understand the nuances of user requests, resulting in more reliable and relevant data queries. This reduces the need for users to rephrase their questions and improves the overall accuracy of AI-generated analytics.

### 🤖 Improved Scout Queries and Chart Displays

**What's New**  
Scout, the AI-powered query assistant, is now better at understanding your questions and using report templates. Additionally, charts with a large number of items in the legend will now have a maximum height and a scrollbar to prevent them from taking up too much vertical space.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *AI > Scout* (when asking natural language questions).
- *Analytics > Report View* (on any chart with a long legend, like a pie or bar chart with many categories).

#### What You Can Do
- Get more accurate results from Scout, as it can now better match your questions to existing report templates.
- View charts with many categories without the page becoming excessively long; simply scroll within the chart's container to see all the data.

#### Why This Matters
These changes improve both the intelligence of the AI assistant and the usability of the charts it generates. You get better answers from Scout, and the resulting visualizations are cleaner and easier to manage.
