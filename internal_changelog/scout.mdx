### 🗣️ Scout Now Clarifies Data Deviations Upfront

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
When you ask Scout for data and the system cannot provide an exact match, Scout will now explicitly state any limitations or deviations at the beginning of its response, before showing any charts or data.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ScoutMastra` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Scout* (chat interface)

#### What You Can Do
- **Example Scenario:** You ask for "a list of promos used per rider," but the underlying data is structured as one row per rider-promo combination (not aggregated per rider).
- **Before:** Scout might have said, "Here is the list of promos used per rider..." followed by a potentially misleading chart.
- **Now:** Scout will clarify upfront, "Note: The data below shows each instance of a promo being used by a rider, rather than an aggregated list per rider. Here is the chart..."

#### Why This Matters
Previously, Scout could present data that didn't perfectly match a request, with important caveats buried at the end. This change ensures you are immediately aware of any data proxies or structural differences, leading to more accurate interpretations and preventing misunderstandings.

### 🤝 Improved "Provider" Terminology Recognition for Scout

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
Scout's analytical capabilities have been enhanced to recognize the term "provider" as an alternative for "fleet." This allows users to ask questions using either term and receive accurate results without needing to know the system's specific terminology.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ScoutMastra` feature flag.
- Requires Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a language-understanding improvement when interacting with the Scout AI agent.

#### What You Can Do
- Ask Scout questions using the word "provider" interchangeably with "fleet."
- For example, you can now ask, "What was our best performing provider last month?" and Scout will correctly understand that "provider" refers to a fleet.

#### Why This Matters
Different organizations use different terminology. By understanding that "provider" and "fleet" can mean the same thing, Scout becomes more flexible and easier to interact with, reducing friction when asking data-driven questions.

**What's New**  
You can now directly mention Spare entities like riders, drivers, services, and requests in the Scout chat interface by typing the `@` symbol, providing direct context for more accurate AI-powered analytics.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ScoutMastra` and `AiChat` feature flags

- **Find Entities:** Search for specific riders, drivers, vehicles, services, or other platform entities by name or ID.
- **Add to Message:** Select an entity to add it as a "mention chip" to your message.
- **Ask Contextual Questions:** Ask Scout questions related to the mentioned entity, such as "How many trips has @RiderName taken this month?" or "Show me all no-shows for @Service_Name."

#### Why This Matters
Mentioning entities provides direct, unambiguous context to Scout, leading to more accurate and relevant answers. This eliminates the need for Scout to guess which entity you're referring to and enables powerful, targeted analytics queries through natural conversation.

### 🧠 Scout Now Directly Uses Knowledge Base and Glossary

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
The AI agent, Scout, has been updated to be more resilient and knowledgeable. It now directly accesses the Knowledge Base and Glossary to understand domain-specific terms (like "duty" or "no-show") before responding, reducing instances where it asks for clarification on common transit terms.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ScoutMastra` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is an underlying improvement to the behavior of the Scout AI assistant.

#### What You Can Do
- When you ask Scout a question containing a transit-specific term, it is now prompted to first check the internal glossary and knowledge base for a definition before attempting to answer.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, Scout might not understand specific industry terminology and would give up or ask for clarification too easily. This change makes Scout more self-sufficient and capable of providing more accurate answers by leveraging existing knowledge resources.

### ♿ Scout AI Chat Accessibility for Screen Readers

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
The Scout AI chat feature is now more accessible for users with visual impairments who use screen readers. As Scout generates a response, the screen reader will announce the content as it streams in, providing a real-time experience.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AiChat` and `ScoutMastra` feature flags
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Scout* (the entire chat interface)

#### What You Can Do
- This is an accessibility improvement with no visual changes. It improves the experience for users of screen reader software (like VoiceOver, NVDA, or JAWS).
- **Before**: Screen readers could not effectively read out the streaming AI responses or navigate the chat interface.
- **Now**: Proper ARIA labels, roles, and live regions have been added. When a user asks Scout a question, their screen reader will announce the response as it is being generated, word by word.

#### Why This Matters
This enhancement ensures that all users, including those with visual impairments, can effectively use Scout to get information and analyze data, promoting a more inclusive and accessible platform.

#### Why This Matters
The new query summary eliminates ambiguity, ensuring you understand exactly what data is being presented. By respecting organization-level settings for key metrics, Scout now delivers more accurate and contextually relevant answers without requiring you to specify these preferences in every query.

### 📊 Scout AI Query Results Capped at 1,000 Rows

**What's New**  
To improve performance and prevent browser issues, analytics queries generated by the Scout AI assistant are now limited to a maximum of 1,000 rows.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `Scout` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Scout AI Assistant* (when asking for analytics data that returns a table)

#### What You Can Do
- If you ask for a query that would return more than 1,000 rows (e.g., "show me all trips from last year"), the results will be automatically capped at 1,000.
- If you ask for a specific number below 1,000 (e.g., "show me the top 10 drivers"), that limit will be respected.

#### Why This Matters
Requesting extremely large datasets could cause the Admin portal to become slow or unresponsive. This limit ensures a stable and performant experience when using the Scout AI for data analysis.
