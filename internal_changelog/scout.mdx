### 🤖 Improved Scout Queries and Chart Displays

**What's New**  
Scout, the AI-powered query assistant, is now better at understanding your questions and using report templates. Additionally, charts with a large number of items in the legend will now have a maximum height and a scrollbar to prevent them from taking up too much vertical space.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *AI > Scout* (when asking natural language questions).
- *Analytics > Report View* (on any chart with a long legend, like a pie or bar chart with many categories).

#### What You Can Do
- Get more accurate results from Scout, as it can now better match your questions to existing report templates.
- View charts with many categories without the page becoming excessively long; simply scroll within the chart's container to see all the data.

#### Why This Matters
These changes improve both the intelligence of the AI assistant and the usability of the charts it generates. You get better answers from Scout, and the resulting visualizations are cleaner and easier to manage.
