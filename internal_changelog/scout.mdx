### 🤖 AI-Powered Analytics Query Generation

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
An experimental AI agent is now available in Scout that can understand natural language questions and automatically generate complex analytics queries. The agent uses semantic search to find relevant report templates and data fields to build its response.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ScoutMastra` feature flag.
- Requires Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Admin > AI > Chat* (when the feature is enabled)

#### What You Can Do
- Ask complex analytical questions in plain English, such as "Show me the on-time performance by service for last month as a bar chart" or "What were the top 5 reasons for cancellations?". The agent will attempt to generate and run a corresponding analytics query.

#### Why This Matters
This technology aims to make data analysis more accessible by allowing users to get insights without needing to know the underlying data schema or how to use the Query Builder. It significantly lowers the barrier to data exploration.

### ✏️ Edit Scout AI Charts Directly in Report Builder

**What's New**  
When viewing a data chart generated by Scout AI, you can now open it directly in the Analytics Report Builder for further editing and exploration. A new "Edit with report builder" option has been added to the chart's action menu.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AiChat` and `AnalyticsV2` feature flags.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *AI > Chat* (in the three-dot dropdown menu of a chart generated by Scout).

#### What You Can Do
- After Scout generates a chart, click the menu on the chart card and select "Edit with report builder".
- This action navigates you to the *Analytics > Query Builder* page with the complete query from the Scout-generated chart pre-loaded and ready for modification.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, to refine a chart created by Scout, you had to manually reconstruct the entire query in the Report Builder. This enhancement creates a seamless workflow, allowing you to use Scout for initial discovery and then transition to the full power of the Report Builder with a single click to fine-tune your analysis.

### 🤖 New AI Architecture for Scout

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
Scout can now be run on a new, experimental multi-agent AI architecture. This foundational upgrade uses a team of specialized AI agents to better understand context and respond to complex questions, particularly those involving analytics or API data.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `ScoutMastra` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a backend change that affects all interactions within the *Scout chat window* when the feature flag is enabled.

#### What You Can Do
- Interact with a more capable version of Scout that can better handle sophisticated queries.

#### Why This Matters
This proof-of-concept is a significant step toward improving Scout's accuracy, speed, and reasoning capabilities. The new architecture is designed to make Scout a more powerful and reliable tool for getting answers about your operations.

### 📊 Scout AI Query Results Capped at 1,000 Rows

**What's New**  
To improve performance and prevent browser issues, analytics queries generated by the Scout AI assistant are now limited to a maximum of 1,000 rows.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `Scout` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Scout AI Assistant* (when asking for analytics data that returns a table)

#### What You Can Do
- If you ask for a query that would return more than 1,000 rows (e.g., "show me all trips from last year"), the results will be automatically capped at 1,000.
- If you ask for a specific number below 1,000 (e.g., "show me the top 10 drivers"), that limit will be respected.

#### Why This Matters
Requesting extremely large datasets could cause the Admin portal to become slow or unresponsive. This limit ensures a stable and performant experience when using the Scout AI for data analysis.

### 🧠 Scout AI Understands More Transit and Case Management Terms

**What's New**  
Scout AI's internal glossary has been expanded with over 70 new terms related to public transit and Spare Engage (case management). This enhances the AI's ability to understand natural language questions and generate more accurate analytics queries.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires the AI Product to be enabled or Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Scout > Chat*

#### What You Can Do
- Ask Scout questions using more specific terminology related to case management (e.g., "Case Priority", "Case Status") or general transit concepts (e.g., "Headway", "Layover", "Deadhead").

#### Why This Matters
A broader vocabulary allows Scout to better understand the nuances of user requests, resulting in more reliable and relevant data queries. This reduces the need for users to rephrase their questions and improves the overall accuracy of AI-generated analytics.

### 🤖 Improved Scout Queries and Chart Displays

**What's New**  
Scout, the AI-powered query assistant, is now better at understanding your questions and using report templates. Additionally, charts with a large number of items in the legend will now have a maximum height and a scrollbar to prevent them from taking up too much vertical space.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *AI > Scout* (when asking natural language questions).
- *Analytics > Report View* (on any chart with a long legend, like a pie or bar chart with many categories).

#### What You Can Do
- Get more accurate results from Scout, as it can now better match your questions to existing report templates.
- View charts with many categories without the page becoming excessively long; simply scroll within the chart's container to see all the data.

#### Why This Matters
These changes improve both the intelligence of the AI assistant and the usability of the charts it generates. You get better answers from Scout, and the resulting visualizations are cleaner and easier to manage.
