### 🛡️ Improved Stability for Scout Analytics Queries

**What's New**  
To improve performance and prevent browser issues, analytics queries generated by Scout are now automatically limited to a maximum of 1,000 rows.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `scout` feature flag.
- Requires Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This change affects the behavior of the *Scout* AI assistant when it generates a data table or chart in response to a prompt.

#### What You Can Do
- Ask Scout a question that could return a very large dataset, such as "show me all trips from last month." The resulting table will be capped at 1,000 rows to ensure stability.
- If you ask for a specific number of results less than 1,000 (e.g., "show me the top 10"), that smaller limit will be respected.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, asking Scout for a query that returned thousands of rows could cause the Admin portal to slow down or become unresponsive. This limit ensures a stable and performant experience when using Scout for data analysis.

### 🧠 Scout AI Understands More Transit and Case Management Terms

**What's New**  
Scout AI's internal glossary has been expanded with over 70 new terms related to public transit and Spare Engage (case management). This enhances the AI's ability to understand natural language questions and generate more accurate analytics queries.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires the AI Product to be enabled or Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Scout > Chat*

#### What You Can Do
- Ask Scout questions using more specific terminology related to case management (e.g., "Case Priority", "Case Status") or general transit concepts (e.g., "Headway", "Layover", "Deadhead").

#### Why This Matters
A broader vocabulary allows Scout to better understand the nuances of user requests, resulting in more reliable and relevant data queries. This reduces the need for users to rephrase their questions and improves the overall accuracy of AI-generated analytics.

### 🤖 Improved Scout Queries and Chart Displays

**What's New**  
Scout, the AI-powered query assistant, is now better at understanding your questions and using report templates. Additionally, charts with a large number of items in the legend will now have a maximum height and a scrollbar to prevent them from taking up too much vertical space.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Admin access
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *AI > Scout* (when asking natural language questions).
- *Analytics > Report View* (on any chart with a long legend, like a pie or bar chart with many categories).

#### What You Can Do
- Get more accurate results from Scout, as it can now better match your questions to existing report templates.
- View charts with many categories without the page becoming excessively long; simply scroll within the chart's container to see all the data.

#### Why This Matters
These changes improve both the intelligence of the AI assistant and the usability of the charts it generates. You get better answers from Scout, and the resulting visualizations are cleaner and easier to manage.
