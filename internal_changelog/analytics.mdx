### 📊 Improved Column Names in SQL Editor Results

**What's New**  
Column names in SQL Editor query results are now automatically formatted to be more readable. Technical suffixes like `_dim` are removed, and `snake_case` or `camelCase` names are converted to "Title Case" for a cleaner presentation in charts and tables.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > SQL Editor* (in the column headers of the results table and chart legends)

- *Analytics > Query Builder* (when a new report is started and a data source is selected, the time dimension field will be pre-populated).

#### What You Can Do
- The system now pre-selects a more logical time dimension, such as `Pickup (Time)` for trip-related reports, providing a better starting point for your analysis. You can still change it to any other time dimension.

#### Why This Matters
The previous default (`created_at`) was often not the most useful time dimension for analysis. This change provides a more intelligent default, reducing the need for manual changes and aligning the initial report more closely with common analytical questions.

### 📊 Download Complete Reports with No Row Limits

**What's New**  
The 10,000-row limit on downloading reports from Analytics V2 has been removed. You can now download the complete dataset for any report, regardless of size, directly from the Query Builder or the Reports List.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag to access Analytics features.
- Requires Admin access.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (the 'Download' button in the top right).
- *Analytics > Reports* (the download action in the list of available reports).

#### What You Can Do
- Download reports in CSV or XLSX format that contain more than 10,000 rows.
- The download process now fetches data in batches, and a notification will show the progress.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, large reports were truncated at 10,000 rows, forcing users to apply narrow filters or find workarounds for complete data analysis. Now, you can export the full dataset for any query, enabling comprehensive analysis and reporting outside of Spare.
