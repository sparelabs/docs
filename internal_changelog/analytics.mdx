### ⚙️ Intelligent Ungrouping for Faster, More Granular Reports

**What's New**  
The Query Builder will now automatically enable an "Ungrouped Mode" for certain queries to deliver more granular, row-level data and improve performance. This behavior can be manually overridden using a new toggle.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag
- Requires Admin access with Analytics permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (new "Ungrouped" toggle and "Optimized" badge in the toolbar)

#### What You Can Do
- The system will automatically enable Ungrouped Mode when it detects that a query would benefit from it (e.g., when all primary keys of a data cube are selected, or when more than 8 dimensions are added).
- An "Optimized" badge will appear next to the "Ungrouped" toggle to indicate that the automatic setting is active.
- Manually switch the "Ungrouped" toggle to "On" or "Off" to override the automatic detection. Your override will be saved with the report.

#### Why This Matters
Some reports, like manifests, require seeing every individual record rather than aggregated data. This feature intelligently detects when an ungrouped, row-level view is needed, improving query performance and providing the right level of detail automatically, while still giving you full manual control.

### 📊 Improved Data Display for Empty Values in Charts and Tables

**What's New**  
Analytics charts and tables now display a dash (`-`) for data points that have no value, instead of showing a zero. This change provides a clearer distinction between a true value of zero and a complete absence of data.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag to access analytics features
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (in all chart and table previews)
- *Analytics > Reports & Dashboards* (on all saved reports)

#### What You Can Do
- **Before**: When a pivot table or chart had no data for a specific cell (e.g., no trips on a Sunday), it would display a `0`. In line charts, this caused a misleading dip to zero.
- **After**: The same empty cell now displays a dash (`-`). In line charts, this creates a visual break in the line, accurately showing that data is missing for that point, not that the value is zero.

#### Why This Matters
This change prevents the misinterpretation of data. Previously, it was impossible to distinguish between a metric that was genuinely zero (e.g., 0 late trips) and a metric for which no data existed, improving the accuracy of visual analysis.
</Accordion>

- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (available in the cube selector dropdown)

#### What You Can Do
- Build reports to count the number of force-matched events over time.
- Use the `Matched Duty Source` dimension to analyze the difference between user-initiated force matches (e.g., from the Live Map) and system-initiated ones.
- Correlate force-matching events with specific duties or times of day to identify operational patterns.

#### Why This Matters
Force-matching is a key operational lever, but analyzing its usage was difficult. This new cube provides direct visibility into force-matching activities, helping you understand dispatcher workload and identify situations where the system's automated matching may need review.

### ⏱️ Improved Date and Time Formatting in Tables

**What's New**  
Date and time values in Analytics tables are now displayed in a cleaner, more human-readable format. Instead of showing full timestamps with milliseconds, the format now intelligently adapts to the granularity of the data (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD` for day, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` for minute).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Report View* (in any report displayed as a Table chart).

#### Why This Matters
Previously, URLs in tables were just plain text, requiring you to copy and paste them into your browser. This enhancement saves time and makes it easier to access linked resources directly from your reports.
</Accordion>

---
### 📅 Smarter Default Time Dimensions for Reports

**What's New**  
When creating a new report, Analytics now selects a more relevant default time dimension based on the data source (cube) you are using. For example, reports based on the `Requests` cube will now default to `Request Scheduled At (Time)` instead of `Request Created At (Time)`.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag
- Requires Admin access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (when a new report is started and a data source is selected, the time dimension field will be pre-populated).

#### What You Can Do
- The system now pre-selects a more logical time dimension, such as `Pickup (Time)` for trip-related reports, providing a better starting point for your analysis. You can still change it to any other time dimension.

#### Why This Matters
The previous default (`created_at`) was often not the most useful time dimension for analysis. This change provides a more intelligent default, reducing the need for manual changes and aligning the initial report more closely with common analytical questions.
