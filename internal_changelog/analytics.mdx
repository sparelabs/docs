### 📊 Download Complete Reports with No Row Limits

**What's New**  
The 10,000-row limit on downloading reports from Analytics V2 has been removed. You can now download the complete dataset for any report, regardless of size, directly from the Query Builder or the Reports List.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag to access Analytics features.
- Requires Admin access.

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (the 'Download' button in the top right).
- *Analytics > Reports* (the download action in the list of available reports).

#### What You Can Do
- Download reports in CSV or XLSX format that contain more than 10,000 rows.
- The download process now fetches data in batches, and a notification will show the progress.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, large reports were truncated at 10,000 rows, forcing users to apply narrow filters or find workarounds for complete data analysis. Now, you can export the full dataset for any query, enabling comprehensive analysis and reporting outside of Spare.
