### 🎨 Redesigned Analytics Query Builder Panel

**What's New**  
The side panel in the Analytics Query Builder has been completely redesigned for a more intuitive experience. It now features two distinct sections: "Selected Members" at the top (showing what's in your report) and "Available Members" at the bottom (for browsing all options), and resolves an issue where the panel would jump to the top of the screen.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access and the Analytics V2 module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (the left-side panel for selecting dimensions and measures).

#### What You Can Do
- View currently selected dimensions and measures in the dedicated "Selected Members" card.
- Browse and search all available data points in the "Available Members" card.
- Expand and collapse time dimensions without the page scroll position jumping unexpectedly.
- Use the "Show all metrics" button within the "Selected Members" card to quickly find and add related metrics from the same cube.

#### Why This Matters
The previous design, with a single list and a "Used Only" toggle, could be confusing. The new two-panel layout makes it much clearer what is currently in your report versus what is available to be added, streamlining the report-building process.

### 📅 More Readable Date and Time Formatting in Reports

**What's New**  
Date and time values in Analytics charts and tables are now displayed in cleaner, more human-readable formats. For example, timestamps now default to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` (excluding seconds and milliseconds), and formats adjust based on the selected time granularity (e.g., Day, Week, Month).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access and the Analytics V2 module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > [Any Report with a Table or Chart]* (in table cells and on chart axes).

#### What You Can Do
- View timestamps in tables in a clean `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` format.
- See chart axes automatically adjust their date format based on the granularity (e.g., showing `Jan 2025` for monthly data).
- Create reports that are easier to read and interpret without being cluttered by overly precise timestamps.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, timestamps included distracting and often unnecessary seconds and milliseconds. The new, context-aware formatting makes reports significantly easier to read and understand at a glance.

### 💬 New Driver Communication Analytics

**What's New**  
Two new data cubes are now available in Analytics: `Duty Conversations` and `Duty Conversation Messages`. These allow you to analyze communications between dispatchers and drivers, including message content, author details, and response times. A new `Driver Full Name` field has also been added for clearer reporting.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access and the Analytics V2 module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (new `Duty Conversations` and `Duty Conversation Messages` cubes available in the data source selector).

#### What You Can Do
- Report on the number of conversations and messages per duty, driver, or time period.
- Analyze message content, author types (driver, dispatcher, system), and timestamps.
- Measure key metrics like average response time for driver-initiated conversations.

#### Why This Matters
This provides direct visibility into operational communications, helping you understand communication patterns, measure response times, and identify areas for improvement in your dispatch-driver interactions.

### 📊 Stacked Bar Charts

**What's New**  
Stacked bar charts are now available as a chart type in Analytics. This allows you to visualize how different segments contribute to a total, making it easier to compare proportional data across categories.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access and the Analytics V2 module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder > Chart Settings* (the "Stacked Bar" option is now available in the chart type dropdown).

#### What You Can Do
- Create reports that show part-to-whole relationships, such as the breakdown of trip outcomes by service.
- Compare the composition of totals across different time periods or categories (e.g., how the proportion of booking channels changes month-over-month).

#### Why This Matters
This restores a key visualization option that is essential for part-to-whole analysis, providing deeper insights into the composition of your data.

### 🔍 Filter NTD Reports by Open Fleet Product

**What's New**  
The NTD Report in Analytics can now be filtered by "Open Fleet Product." This allows you to specify which of your integrated Open Fleet services should be included in the report's calculations.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access and the Analytics V2 module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (when building a report using the `ntd_report` cube, a new `Fleet Product` dimension is available for filtering).

#### What You Can Do
- Isolate NTD data to a specific Open Fleet provider.
- Combine data from multiple, but not all, Open Fleet providers in a single report.
- Exclude certain Open Fleet services from your NTD reporting.

#### Why This Matters
This gives you more granular control over NTD reporting, ensuring that only relevant Open Fleet data is included and your reports accurately reflect the scope of service you intend to analyze.

### ⏱️ Smarter Default Time Filters in Query Builder

**What's New**  
The Analytics Query Builder now intelligently selects a more relevant default time dimension when you create a new report. For example, when analyzing requests, it will now default to a pickup time dimension instead of the less intuitive `created_at` timestamp.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access and the Analytics V2 module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (when a new report is created, a more relevant time dimension is pre-selected in the "Selected Members" panel).

#### What You Can Do
- Start building reports with a more logical time dimension already selected.
- The system defaults to dimensions like `requests.pickup_scheduled_time` for request-based cubes.
- If the preferred default doesn't exist, it falls back to the previous behavior to prevent errors.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, the default time dimension was often `created_at`, which required users to manually change it for most analyses. This change provides a more logical starting point, saving time and reducing the chance of errors in your reports.

### 🔗 Automatic URL Linking in Report Tables

**What's New**  
Table charts in Analytics now automatically recognize text values that are URLs and convert them into clickable links, allowing for quick navigation directly from your reports.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access and the Analytics V2 module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > [Any Report Displayed as a Table Chart]* (any cell containing text that starts with `http://` or `https://`).

#### What You Can Do
- Click directly on a URL within a report table to open it in a new tab.
- This works for any data field that contains a full URL, such as links to external surveys, documentation, or other web resources.

#### Why This Matters
This makes it easier to access external resources or other parts of Spare directly from your reports, saving you the effort of manually copying and pasting URLs from table cells.

### 💡 Persistent Date Filter Tooltip on Dashboards

**What's New**  
On Analytics Dashboards, a tooltip now consistently appears on reports that are not affected by the dashboard's date filter. This makes it clear to all users which reports are static and which are dynamic.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access and the Analytics V2 module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Dashboards > [Dashboard Name]* (a tooltip appears on chart widgets that lack a time dimension).

#### What You Can Do
- Hover over the info icon next to a report's title on a dashboard to see the message: "This report will not be affected by the date filter as it does not have a time dimension."
- This tooltip is now visible in both view and edit modes.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, this helpful indicator was only visible in edit mode. Now, all viewers of a dashboard can immediately understand why certain reports don't change when the dashboard's date filter is adjusted.

### 📈 Improved Chart Display for Large Datasets

**What's New**  
Charts in Analytics now handle large amounts of data more gracefully. When a chart has many items in its legend (e.g., many services or vehicle types), the chart container will dynamically resize and become scrollable to ensure it remains usable.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access and the Analytics V2 module.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > [Any Report with a Chart]* (especially noticeable on bar or line charts with more than ~10 series).

#### What You Can Do
- View charts with many data series without the chart growing excessively tall and pushing other content off-screen.
- The chart's height will increase to a certain point and then become vertically scrollable, keeping the dashboard layout clean.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, charts with many legend items could become unusably tall and disrupt the entire page layout. Now, they are contained within a manageable, scrollable area, improving dashboard readability.

### 📈 Unlimited Row Downloads for Analytics Reports

**What's New**  
The 10,000-row limit on report downloads from Analytics has been removed. You can now download complete datasets of any size in CSV or XLSX format, with a new progress indicator to track the download.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to Analytics (V2) features.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (the `Download` button).
- *Analytics > Reports > [select a report]* (the download action in the `Download Report` drawer).

#### What You Can Do
- Download reports containing hundreds of thousands of rows without any limits.
- Monitor the status of large downloads via a new progress indicator that shows the number of rows processed.
- Cancel a download that is in progress.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, analyzing large datasets required multiple partial downloads, which was inefficient and could lead to errors. Now, you can export the full dataset from any report in a single operation, saving time and ensuring data integrity for large-scale analysis.
