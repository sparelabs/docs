### 📈 Unlimited Row Downloads for Analytics Reports

**What's New**  
The 10,000-row limit on report downloads from Analytics has been removed. You can now download complete datasets of any size in CSV or XLSX format, with a new progress indicator to track the download.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires access to Analytics (V2) features.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (the `Download` button).
- *Analytics > Reports > [select a report]* (the download action in the `Download Report` drawer).

#### What You Can Do
- Download reports containing hundreds of thousands of rows without any limits.
- Monitor the status of large downloads via a new progress indicator that shows the number of rows processed.
- Cancel a download that is in progress.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, analyzing large datasets required multiple partial downloads, which was inefficient and could lead to errors. Now, you can export the full dataset from any report in a single operation, saving time and ensuring data integrity for large-scale analysis.
