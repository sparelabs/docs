### 🗺️ More Accurate ETAs for Trips with Long Wait Times

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
The routing engine has been enhanced to more accurately calculate travel times for trip legs that occur after a long period of scheduled waiting. The system now correctly uses the traffic conditions expected at the actual departure time, not the arrival time at the preceding stop.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LiveTraffic` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a backend Engine improvement. The results are visible in ETAs across the platform, such as on the *Launch > Live Map*.

#### What You Can Do
- **Example Scenario:** A driver drops off a passenger at 2:00 PM (Point A) and is scheduled to wait there until 3:00 PM before departing for the next pickup (Point B).
- **Before:** The travel time from A to B might have been calculated based on traffic conditions at 2:00 PM.
- **Now:** The travel time is correctly calculated based on the expected traffic at the 3:00 PM departure time, resulting in a more accurate ETA for Point B and all subsequent stops.

#### Why This Matters
Inaccurate ETAs caused by long wait times could lead to inefficient dispatching and incorrect arrival predictions for riders. This update ensures that travel time calculations are more realistic, improving the reliability of schedules and ETAs for both drivers and riders.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Arrive-By Time Calculation for Recurring Trips**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed a bug where pickup windows for "arrive-by" recurring trips were sometimes calculated incorrectly, resulting in estimated and scheduled times that were too early. The system now correctly identifies recurring trips during all estimation and matching phases to provide accurate time windows.

### 🗺️ Dynamic Travel Time Updates for More Accurate ETAs

<Warning>This feature is currently categorized as 'Do Not Enable - In Development' and is not yet ready for customer use. Please await communications from the Product team on a feature rollout plan.</Warning>

**What's New**  
A new automated background job periodically refreshes the direct travel time for active and upcoming trips. This ensures that the system's understanding of travel durations remains current, especially when live traffic data is used.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `LiveTraffic` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a backend enhancement with no direct UI. The impact will be seen in the accuracy of system calculations.

#### What You Can Do
- The primary benefit is improved system performance without user action. The system will automatically:
  - Re-calculate direct travel times for trips scheduled in the near future.
  - Update detour flexibility calculations with more current data.
  - Provide more accurate ETAs and pickup windows when live traffic conditions change.

#### Why This Matters
Stale travel time data can lead to inaccurate ETAs and inefficient routing, especially in areas with variable traffic. This recurring job ensures that the optimization engine is always working with the most up-to-date information, improving the reliability of schedules and the overall rider experience.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Arrive By V2 Logic for Open Fleets (MOT-2635)**
  - _Resolution_: Corrected the `Arrive By V2` matching logic to ensure it applies exclusively to dedicated fleets. Previously, it was also being applied to open fleets, which could result in undesirably early pickup windows. This fix ensures open fleet trips use standard time calculations. This behavior is active when the `ArriveByV2` feature flag is enabled.
