  ### Twilio Connection Setup for Super Admins üîß

  **What's New**

  Super admins can now create Twilio connections directly from the admin interface through a new "Create Twilio Connection" button.

  **Where You'll See It**

  The "Create Twilio Connection" button appears on the Twilio Connection list page (`/launch/twilioConnections`) when:

  - You have super admin permissions
  - The organization has no existing Twilio connections

![Create Twilio Connection](/images/changelogs/CreateTwillioConnection.png)

  **What You Can Do**

  When you click the button, a modal opens where you can configure:

  - SMS messaging
  - AI Voice calls
  - Call forwarding
  - AI Chat
  - Area code selection
  - Optional alphanumeric sender ID

  The system automatically provisions a complete Twilio subaccount with phone numbers and sets up all necessary webhooks for you.

  **Why This Matters**

  Previously, setting up Twilio required backend engineering support. Now super admins can get new organizations up and running with SMS and voice capabilities in minutes instead of days.

  ### Vehicle Type Assignment for Trip Groups üöê

  **What's New**

  You can now assign specific vehicle types to trip groups and filter trip groups by vehicle type.

  **Where You'll See It**

  - Trip Group creation/edit forms: New "Vehicle Type" field with dropdown selector
  - Trip Group list page: New "Vehicle Type" column and filter option
  - The field shows "Any Vehicle Type" when no specific type is assigned
  - **No feature flags or special permissions required** - available to all users with trip group access

  **What You Can Do**

  When creating or editing a trip group, select a specific vehicle type (like wheelchair-accessible van, sedan, or SUV). You can also filter the trip group list to show only groups for specific vehicle types.

  **Why This Matters**

  If you're managing different types of vehicles (wheelchair-accessible, different sizes, special equipment), you can now organize your recurring trip groups by vehicle type. This helps ensure the right vehicles are assigned to the right trips and makes your trip group list easier to navigate.

  ### Trip Group Request View üìã

  **What's New**

  When viewing a recurring trip group details page, you can now see all associated requests directly on that page.

  **Where You'll See It**

  Recurring trip group details page - a new section shows all requests linked to that trip group.

  - **No feature flags or special permissions required** - available to all users with trip group access

  **What You Can Do**

  View which specific trip requests are part of each recurring group without leaving the trip group page.

  **Why This Matters**

  Previously, you had to navigate back and forth between trip groups and request lists to see which requests were grouped together. Now it's all in one place, making it faster to understand and manage recurring trips.

  ### Mobile App Deep Link Configuration üì±

  **What's New**

  Added a "Deep Link URL" field in mobile app configuration settings.

  **Where You'll See It**

  Mobile app configuration section in admin settings.

  - **Requires Administrator access**

  **What You Can Do**

  Enter custom deep link URLs that can open specific screens directly in your rider or driver mobile apps.

  **Why This Matters**

  Makes it easier to create links in emails, notifications, or other channels that take users directly to specific app screens, improving the mobile user experience.

  ### Real-Time Rider Location Updates for Drivers üìç

  **What's New**

  Drivers now see rider locations update in real-time on their map when riders share their location.

  **How It Works**

  - When a rider shares their location, it appears on the driver's map
  - The location marker moves in real-time as the rider moves
  - Connection status indicator shows connected/connecting/error states
  - Automatically reconnects when the app comes back from background

  **Where You'll See It**

  Driver app - on the map view when viewing upcoming stops and during active trips.

  - **No feature flags required** - automatically available when riders share location

  **Why This Matters**

  Instead of seeing static or periodically updated locations, drivers see live movement. If a rider walks to a different pickup point or moves around a large area like a mall or airport, the driver sees exactly where they are in real-time. This significantly reduces "where are you?" phone calls and makes pickups smoother.

  ### Trip Negotiation Analytics Dashboard üìä

  **What's New**

  A new analytics dashboard specifically for trip negotiations is now available.

  **What You Can See**

  - Trip negotiation success rates
  - How long negotiations typically take
  - Patterns in which trip types get negotiated most
  - Negotiation outcomes (accepted, declined, expired)

  **Where You'll See It**

  Analytics section - new "Trip Negotiation" cube/dashboard.

  - **`Requires AnalyticsV2 feature flag`** to access analytics dashboards
  - **`Requires TripNegotiation feature flag`** to use trip negotiation features

  **Why This Matters**

  If you're using trip negotiation features, you can now track how well they're working. See which types of trips require negotiation most often, how quickly negotiations resolve, and where you might be able to improve your negotiation parameters or processes.
