## 🔧 Resolve
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Form Address Field UI Cleanup (ENG-708)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where headers from the address input field (e.g., "Search for an address") were incorrectly appearing in the table of contents on forms. The address search field has also been updated to align with the platform's standard look and feel.
