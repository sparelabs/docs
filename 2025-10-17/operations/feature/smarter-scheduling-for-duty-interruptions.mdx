## Operations

### ⏱️ Smarter Scheduling for Duty Interruptions

### 

**What's New**  
When creating a duty interruption (like an impromptu break), the system now intelligently handles situations where the duty is ending soon. If the full interruption doesn't fit, the system will automatically create a shorter one if possible and notify you of the adjustment.


**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Operations > Live Map > (select a duty) > Breaks tab* (when using the "Add Break" button)

#### What You Can Do
- Create an immediate interruption for a driver near the end of their duty.
- The system will automatically shorten the interruption to the maximum possible duration if the requested length exceeds the remaining duty time.
- Receive a notification confirming that the interruption was created but shortened to fit the duty schedule.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, attempting to create an interruption that was longer than the remaining duty time would simply fail without a clear explanation. This enhancement prevents failures by creating the longest possible interruption and provides clear feedback, saving dispatchers time and reducing frustration.
