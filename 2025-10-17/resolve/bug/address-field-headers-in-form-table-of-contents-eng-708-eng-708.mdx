## Resolve

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Address Field Headers in Form Table of Contents (ENG-708)**
  - _Resolution_: Resolved a bug where section headers from the address input field (e.g., "Search for an address") were incorrectly appearing in the table of contents when viewing forms in Resolve or Engage. The address search input has also been visually updated for better consistency.
