### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Service Availability for Estimates in Zoned Services (BUS-3786)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where some services would not appear as available during the initial estimate phase due to time-based zone rules. The system now validates geography first and applies time-based rules only after a specific trip time has been selected.
