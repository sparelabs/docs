### ✈️ New Cross-Region Data Migration Tool

### 

**What's New**  
A new tool is available for Super Admins to migrate data between organizations in different geographical regions. The new interface provides a dedicated workflow for selecting source and destination regions, choosing specific data items to migrate, and viewing detailed results.


**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Super Admin > Data Migrations* (new page at `/super-admin/cross-region-data-migrations`)

#### What You Can Do
- Select a source and destination region (e.g., US, EU) from new dropdown menus.
- Choose the source and destination organizations for the migration.
- Select specific items to migrate, such as Services, Zones, Riders, and Fare Passes, using a detailed checklist.
- Initiate the migration and monitor progress in the "Migration Results" panel.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, migrating configurations between regions was a manual, error-prone process. This purpose-built tool streamlines cross-region setups, making it faster and more reliable for Super Admins to launch new services or duplicate configurations across Spare's global infrastructure.
