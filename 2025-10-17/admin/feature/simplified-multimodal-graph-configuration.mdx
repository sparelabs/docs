## Admin

### üó∫Ô∏è Simplified Multimodal Graph Configuration

### 

**What's New**  
The interface for managing Multimodal graphs has been completely redesigned and moved directly into each organization's settings. This new organization-centric view simplifies configuration, shows the current build status of the graph, and includes a "Request Rebuild" button to easily trigger an update.


**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Super Admin > Organizations > (select an organization) > Multimodal Graph tab*

#### What You Can Do
- View and manage all multimodal graph settings for a single organization in one place.
- Check the "Graph Status" card to see when the graph was last built and if it's up to date.
- Click the "Request Rebuild" button to trigger a new graph build after updating datasets.
- Add, edit, and remove datasets (e.g., GTFS, Flex) in a context that is filtered to the specific organization.

#### Why This Matters
The previous graph management UI was complex and required navigating region-wide lists, increasing the risk of configuration errors. This new, streamlined workflow is more intuitive and reduces errors by scoping all actions to a single organization.
