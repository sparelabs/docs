## Admin

### ⚙️ Set a Default Country for Your Organization

### 

**What's New**  
Administrators can now set a default country for their organization. This country's flag and dialing code will automatically appear in phone number fields, such as when adding a new rider, streamlining data entry for international operations.


**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator or Super admin permissions


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Organization > General* (new "Default Country" dropdown)
- *People > Riders > Add Rider* (phone number input field)
- *Super Admin > Organizations > Edit/New Organization* (new "Default Country" dropdown)

#### What You Can Do
- Set a "Default Country" for your organization from a comprehensive list.
- When creating a new rider, the phone number input will automatically default to the selected country's flag and dialing code (e.g., +44 for the UK).

#### Why This Matters
This feature simplifies data entry for agencies operating outside the US. By pre-selecting the correct country code, it reduces manual effort and minimizes the risk of entering incorrect phone numbers for riders.
