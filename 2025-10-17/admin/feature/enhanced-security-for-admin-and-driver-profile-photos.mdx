### ðŸ‘¤ Enhanced Security for Admin and Driver Profile Photos

### 

**What's New**  
Profile photo URLs for administrators and drivers now use secure, temporary links, enhancing data privacy. As part of this update, the "Photo" column has been removed from the main list views for Drivers and Admins, aligning their behavior with the existing security model for Riders.


**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *People > Drivers* (list view)
- *Settings > Team > Admins* (list view)

#### What You Can Do
- You will no longer see the "Photo" column in the main data tables for drivers and administrators.
- Profile photos remain visible on individual driver and admin profile pages.

#### Why This Matters
This change enhances security by ensuring that profile photos are not accessible via permanent, public links. Removing the photo column from list views also improves page load performance for organizations with many drivers or admins.
