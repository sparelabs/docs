## 📊 Analytics
### 📊 Query Group Membership Custom Fields Directly

**What's New**  
Custom fields on Group Memberships are now directly accessible as dimensions within the `Group Membership` data cube in Analytics, enabling more detailed reporting on your rider groups.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (when selecting dimensions from the `Group Membership` data cube).

#### What You Can Do
- Build reports that filter, segment, or measure based on custom fields defined on your rider group memberships. For example, you can now report on trip counts by riders with a specific 'Certification Level' custom field.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, accessing group membership custom fields was limited and required complex queries. This change makes it much easier to build reports that directly leverage the unique data you store on group memberships.

### 📊 Join Case Data with Administrator Details

**What's New**  
A new data relationship has been added in Analytics, allowing you to connect the `Case Data` cube to the `Organization Admin` cube to report on cases by their assigned administrator's details.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (when building a report using the `Case Data` cube).

#### What You Can Do
- Create reports that include details about the administrator assigned to a case. For example, you can now group the total number of open cases by the assignee's first and last name.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, it was not possible to link case data to the administrators they were assigned to, limiting reporting capabilities. This change enables more detailed analysis of case management workloads by allowing you to include assignee information in your reports.
