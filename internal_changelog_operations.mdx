### ‚è±Ô∏è Better Handling for Duty Interruptions

**What's New**  
When creating a duty interruption that is too long to fit before a duty's scheduled end time, the system will now automatically shorten it to the maximum possible duration. You will receive a specific notification indicating that the interruption has been shortened.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Duties* (when clicking on a duty and using the 'Add Break' modal for an 'Interruption').

#### What You Can Do
- Create a duty interruption near the end of a duty's shift.
- If the interruption is too long, the system will create a shorter one and notify you of the adjusted duration (e.g., "Interruption created but shortened to 15 minutes").
- If no time is available at all, you will receive a clear failure message (e.g., "Could not create interruption as there is not enough time remaining in the duty").

#### Why This Matters
Previously, attempting to create an interruption that couldn't fit on a duty would simply fail without a clear reason. This change improves the workflow by creating a partial interruption when possible and providing clear, actionable feedback to dispatchers.
