Some of the use-cases that you can power with 

Workflows are:

Eligibility Case Lifecycle Notifications

Custom Cancellation or No Show Policies

Automated Letter Generation

and whatever you can come up with!

## How does Spare's Workflow Builder work?![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1114519507/20eccece4aa44536952e8caa/Screenshot+2024-07-15+at+5_36_55%E2%80%AFPM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=627dda12dfac23f968f7be5d5ec8ed5160adb85991629180be81908bc3da0430&req=dSEmEsx%2FlIRfXvMW1HO4zWDT7Di8iRFBzbdljCAcHmYYzZ0GpTyIbt2Zofr1%0Auhw3%0

A)

You can think of the above conditions as the building blocks of a Workflow. 

### **When** (Trigger)Think of When as the trigger. A Trigger is the green light that starts an automation. 

They kick off a specific process when something happens, some examples can be: 

When a new ride request is created.

When a user updates their profile.

When a case is submitted.

On a [set schedule](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/10414521-scheduled-workflows).

### **If (Conditions/Filter)**These are like checkpoints that ensure the automation only runs when certain criteria are met. They act as Filters. 

For example: 

You might set a condition to only send a notification if a ride request is for a certain rider or assigned to a certain driver.

If a Case is assigned to a certain Staff member.

### Then (Actions)Actions are what the system does once the triggers and conditions are met. This could be anything from sending a text message to a rider, updating a record, or alerting staff about a change. 

The actions that are currently supported are:
