ðŸ’¡ This feature is included in the Open Fleets package. Please reach out to your Spare Representative for more details.

## About this FeatureWith Open Fleet limitsâ€”Maximum Trips, Budget, per Rider Maximum Tripsâ€”help agencies manage and control the usage of Ope Fleets such as Uber, Lyft, Uzurv and Taxi's effectively. 

By setting these limits on a per-hour, daily, weekly, or monthly basis, administrators can optimize resources, maintain budget oversight, and control individual rider usage.

## How Does It 

Work?## Types of Open Fleet Limits**Maximum 

Trips**

- This setting limits the total number of trips that can be dispatched to the fleet within a specified time period (e.g., per hour, day, week, or month).

Once the limit is reached, no additional trips can be dispatched to this fleet within that period, including any re-dispatched (rematched) trips.

Multiple Maximum Trip limits can be added for a single fleet i.e weekly can be 100 but you set a monthly limit to 200 on top of that.

**Budget Limit**

- Controls the total budget (in monetary terms) available for trips in the fleet. It can be set on a per hour, day, week, or month basis.

If a trip would exceed the set budget limit, it will be denied, but only after the first trip that surpasses the budget.

**Rider Maximum Trips**

- Limits the number of trips an individual rider can book within a set time period.

This limit is specific to each rider and functions independently of the total Maximum Trips limit. For example, if a rider is limited to one trip per hour, they can only book one trip within that period, regardless of other riders' bookings.

## Important Considerations**Rider Maximum Trips Tracking**: Only new trip data (from the time this feature was introduced) is used to enforce the Rider Maximum Trips limit. 

Past trips prior to this update will not count toward the limit.

**Budget Limit with UZURV**: The Budget Limit feature cannot be applied to trips involving UZURV because receipt data is not available for these trips.

## FA

Q's## What happens when the budget is close to its limit?Trips will only be denied after the budget is exceeded by a trip. For example, if the budget is $25, and a trip would cost $24.99, it will still be allowed. 

The next trip that would exceed $25 will be denied.

## Are all past trips counted toward the Rider Maximum Trips limit?No, only trips booked after this featureâ€™s release are counted toward the limit. 

For example, if a rider is limited to 10 trips per month, trips taken before the featureâ€™s introduction do not apply to the count.

## Can I set different time periods for different limits?Yes, each limit (Maximum Trips, Budget, Rider Maximum 

Trips) can be set independently for hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly periods.
