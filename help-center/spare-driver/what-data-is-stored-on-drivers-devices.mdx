## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there a risk of a data breach on devices used by drivers?">
    The Spare Driver app is designed with security in mind. Since no confidential passenger data is stored locally on driver devices, the risk of data exposure from device theft or loss is minimal.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How can I ensure data stored on driver devices is secure?">
    Data security is built into the app's architecture. The stateless design means sensitive information is not cached on the device, providing inherent protection against unauthorized access.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How much data is stored on driver devices?">
    Minimal data is stored locally. The app primarily stores basic operational data needed for functionality, but no confidential passenger information remains on the device.

## How Data Storage Works

<Info>
The Spare Driver app uses and transfers data in a **"stateless" manner**, meaning the app does not store any confidential passenger data on the local device.
</Info>

### Key Security Features

- **Real-time data transfer**: Trip information is sent immediately to secure cloud servers
- **No local passenger data storage**: Confidential information is never cached on the device
- **Secure cloud storage**: All sensitive data is stored on Spare's secure, compliant infrastructure

<Tip>
This stateless architecture ensures that even if a driver's device is lost or stolen, no passenger information is at risk of exposure.
