### Mobile Device Management (MDM)

Spare recommends implementing an MDM (Mobile Device Management) solution to remotely manage all devices from a centralized interface. This is especially important for fleet operations with multiple tablets.

## Driver Account Setup

Before drivers can use the app, a Spare Administrator must create driver accounts through the admin portal.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Admin Portal">
    Navigate to **Spare Operations > Users > Drivers > Add Driver** in the admin interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Driver Profile">
    Complete the driver profile with the required information (see requirements below).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    The system automatically sends an email invitation to the driver.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Driver Sets Password">
    The driver receives the email and creates their password to complete setup.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Required Profile Information

**Required Fields:**
- **First Name** - Driver's legal first name
- **Last Name** - Driver's legal last name  
- **Email Address** - This will serve as the driver's login username

**Optional Fields:**
- Phone Number (not required for app functionality)

<Note>
Drivers will use their **email address** as their login username when accessing the app.
</Note>

### Password Management

Once a driver profile is created, the driver receives an automatic email invitation to set up their password. After creating their password, they can immediately start using the app.

<Tip>
If drivers forget their passwords, administrators can reset them using the **PASSWORD RESET** button in each driver's profile.
