## How It Works

The backup interface allows you to access your manifest and update trip progress via a web browser when the mobile app is unavailable.

## Logging Into the Backup Interface

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Browser">
    Open a browser on your tablet or another internet-enabled device.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to the Regional URL">
    Navigate to the link shared by your administrators. The URL depends on the region you're hosted in:
    
    <Accordion title="Regional URLs">
      - `driver.us.sparedr.com`
      - `driver.us2.sparedr.com`
      - `driver.jp.sparedr.com`
      - `driver.sparedr.com`
    </Accordion>
    
    <Note>
      Please reach out to your Partner Success Manager if you're unsure which URL to use.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Your Credentials">
    Log in using the following credentials:
    
    - **Organization Key:** Unique identifier for your organization
    - **Username:** The same username used for the Spare Driver app
    - **Disaster Recovery Code:** A special code set by your administrators (different from your usual password)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Accessing and Using Your Manifest

Once logged in, you'll view the **most recent backup** of your manifest.

<Warning>
The backup updates every 15 minutes. Completed tasks might need manual updates if the last backup was slightly outdated.
</Warning>

### Trip Information Available

You can view detailed trip information, including:

- Base fare (in cents)
- Number of passengers
- Mobility aid requirements (if applicable)

<Tip>
To navigate to a pickup or drop-off location, tap the blue link to open directions in Google Maps.
</Tip>

## Updating Duty Progress and Returning to the App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mark Trips as Completed">
    Mark trips as **completed** after pickups and drop-offs by selecting the appropriate status for each trip in the manifest.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send Data Before Switching Back">
    Once directed to use the Spare Driver app again, scroll to the bottom of the backup interface and select **Finish Driving and Send Data**.
    
    <Warning>
      This step is critical! If you don't send your data, your trip updates may be lost and won't be reconciled with your dispatch team.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resume Normal Operations">
    Switch back to the Spare Driver app to resume normal operations.
    
    <Note>
      Because the Spare Driver app and the backup interface are separate systems, your Driver App manifest may show trips that you have already completed via the backup interface.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## For Administrators: Receiving Driver Data

After a driver selects **Finish Driving and Send Data**, an email will be sent to your specified Backup Email inbox containing a record of their activity.

This data can be used to reconcile scheduled trip times with actual trip times.
