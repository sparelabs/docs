> **June 2024 Update:** We do not recommend using the process described in this article. We recommend using the new **Vehicle Types** feature to specify the seating capacity of your vehicle. [Follow the instructions here to create Vehicle Types and add them to your vehicles](/help-center/spare-operations-schedulers/schedulers-getting-started/creating-vehicle-types).

Platform users are able to add Accessibility Features to whichever vehicles can accommodate them in their service. To add Accessibility Features, follow these steps: 

## Step 1: Access Vehicles Settings

Navigate to **Shift Scheduling** > **Vehicles**.

Click on the vehicle that you would like to add Accessibility Features to.

## Step 2: Edit Vehicle Settings

Click **Edit Vehicle** in the top right corner.

At the bottom of the screen, you will see **Accessibility Features**. This is where we will be working.

Click on the drop-down where **Wheelchair** is listed to see all of the possible Accessibility Features you can add. This list includes:

- Stroller
- Wheelchair
- Child Seat
- Service Animal
- Bike
- Oversized Wheelchair
- Lift

## Step 3: Add Accessibility Features

Select the Accessibility Feature you would like to add.

You can add as many accessibility features as your vehicle has the capacity for.

Next, add the **Count** or number of this feature this particular vehicle can accommodate. In this example, this vehicle can accommodate 2 wheelchairs.

Next, add the **Number of Passenger Seats Removed** by the accessibility features. In this example, each wheelchair removes 1 passenger seat, so it is set at 1. If no passenger seats are removed, you can keep this at 0.

To ensure the Accessibility Features are properly added, click the **Add** button on the right.

Finally, to save all of your work, click the blue **Save** button in the bottom right of your screen.

**Voila!** Now requests where these accessibility features are required will go to this vehicle (or any other vehicle with the same features).
