In this article, you will find answers to the following questions:

- How do I add new drivers?
- How do I view, edit, or cancel driver records?

All drivers will need their own user profile in Spare Platform (with email and password) in order to log in to the Spare Driver App.

## Add a Driver

To access Drivers information, go to the **Users** tab and select **Drivers**. From there, click **Add Driver** to create a new driver account.

Spare supports two different login types:

- **Username and PIN** - You will enter both values
- **Email and password** - The driver will be emailed an invitation to create their password

Your administrators will have chosen to either use a single type or allow both. Talk to your Spare Representative if you're unsure.

> Note that a phone number is not required for Drivers.

To add multiple Drivers, click on the **Import Drivers** button at the top right of the page. Please make sure you use the correct CSV format.

> If you don't have permission to import drivers, please reach out to your manager.

## Edit a Driver Record

To quickly locate a driver, type in their name, email, or ID in the search bar.

You can also use one of the platform filters to narrow down your search.

To view or edit a Driverâ€™s details, click on their record line. A **Driver information page** will appear. 

From the Driver Information Page, you will be able to do the following:

- **Edit** contact information
- **Delete** the Driver Account
- **View** the fleet information they are associated with
- **Reset** their password

Drivers can also edit their own contact information from within the Driver App.

> Driver emails can only be edited through [import](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/9081245-importing-data-to-spare).
