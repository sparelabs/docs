All drivers will need their own user profile in Spare Platform (with email and password) in order to log in to the Spare Driver App.

To create a new driver, follow the steps below:

Go to the Spare Admin Portal and click on **Users** in the lefthand menu.

Click **Drivers** then **Add Driver** to enter the driver's login credentials.

If using usernames and PINs, keep the following in mind:

**Usernames:**
- Choose meaningful and recognizable usernames for each driver, e.g., first initial + last name
- Each username must be unique to avoid conflicts

**Secure PINs:**
- Assign a numeric PIN to each driver
- Avoid predictable combinations like "1234" or "0000"
- Encourage periodic PIN updates (e.g., every 60-90 days)

> If your organization uses email logins, note that drivers will need to open a setup link that is emailed to them in order to create their password. Once they've done that, they will be able to log into the Spare Driver app.
