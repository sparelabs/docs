## What are vehicle types?

Vehicle types let you set the seating capacity and inspection rules for each kind of vehicle in your fleet. When you create or edit a vehicle, you can choose its type.

If you change the seating rules or inspection process for a vehicle type, those changes will automatically apply to all vehicles of that type.

## Creating Vehicle Types

First, click on **Shift Scheduling** to open the module.

## Specifying the Inspection Process

> Pre & Post Duty Vehicle Inspections are available in the Driver Pro Package. Speak to your Spare Representative to learn more.

You can specify a pre-duty and post-duty inspection form. Inspection forms are created in the **Inspections** menu item. Changes to the form automatically apply to upcoming and in-progress duties.

For more information on Pre & Post Duty Vehicle Inspections, [please read this article](/help-center/spare-operations-schedulers/schedulers-getting-started/pre-post-duty-vehicle-inspections).

## Specifying Seating Capacity

### Step 1: Add Fixed Seats

Begin by adding the total number of fixed seats (seats that don't fold) the vehicle has. Press the **Add Seat** button for each fixed seat. 

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1074399628/a2d0deaa78e4ac8b259ae846/image.png?expires=1753820100&signature=1545370c77cf375df1944d617f67e21e2a474e6acd10c200689325a06f706e11&req=dSAgEsp3lIddUfMW1HO4zdQEZl381PNNh%2FwFcwDvP0PSLrKVLhNzacLG53xc%0Ai%2Fby%0A)

### Step 2: Add Folding Seats

Next, count the number of folding seats, bench seats or jump seats. Click **Add Seat** for each one and set the number of passengers it can hold.

You may also add a description if you want.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1074401797/bc2e1243edfe55a2b374d482/Screenshot+2024-06-07+at+7_57_51%E2%80%AFAM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=e93a0f143154e1dd380c877f0f7bab87041006656d14c236b15a9aa1b933f2c8&req=dSAgEs1%2BnIZWXvMW1HO4zUK2C2qcAm9e43LvPnCLh4a2mJwbwruogc7qYcZx%0Aop%2FG%0A)

**2.1** Add any mobility devices that can be stored when the seat is folded. Press the **Add** button to do this.

![Mobility device configuration interface](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1074411667/2bb484d445e4dee9b888dfd6/Untitled.jpg?expires=1753820100&signature=c4bf506b8532da74d57165a08b07fef7d0ea61ea4396038ddffd9064bf4e9641&req=dSAgEs1%2FnIdZXvMW1HO4zU8ZXwNqd28EyiUJ5z93cporyv5xFUMCdPosLZgi%0ABd0y%0A)

If a rider can stay in their mobility device (like a wheelchair or scooter) for the whole trip, check the box that says _"rider can sit in this location at the same time as this accessibility feature"_.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1074412000/2162fc15b7d052b8b6da98e6/Screenshot+2024-06-07+at+8_11_11%E2%80%AFAM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=a5065cb2b79b14e7dfab33ea78b86d5a77b20f1b7b692b0a24deeb330bb27553&req=dSAgEs1%2Fn4FfWfMW1HO4zSkeMnzI2YAzaZqOYnr0OjKTI7Ha5lEIrW93UEok%0A6EQy%0A)

Repeat the process for all other mobility devices that can be placed in this location.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1074414255/af29d455378bd5997ee1dba6/image.png?expires=1753820100&signature=e38de3a8c64c76961ea56e71eb21f113e8c7001626853feb9b33c1b0468b5bae&req=dSAgEs1%2FmYNaXPMW1HO4zd0smEff7%2Be0N2SifpFUX89z2fJVQsUNEFpMNzvi%0AI%2Fdp%0A)

**2.2** Sometimes, vehicles have two seats that fold independently to reveal a securement location. For example, the location may be able to fit:

- 2 ambulatory passengers if both seats are down
- 1 rider in a wheelchair, 1 rider in a scooter, or 2 walkers if both seats are up
- 1 ambulatory passenger and 1 walker if one seat is up and one seat is down

To allow a rider and mobility device to share the space, check the box that says _"Other types of accessibility features can be placed in this seat alongside seated riders, if there's room"_ for each feature. In this example, check the box for both riders and walkers.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1074419800/6053c68b41931021537b3b7f/Screenshot+2024-06-07+at+8_21_34%E2%80%AFAM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=90d45a6127b121c2686d19f0e612bb05d6cb3bd86ddc4121142c9b92030f2e5a&req=dSAgEs1%2FlIlfWfMW1HO4zbFNEkNdBm67UGWIWSA1%2BWA5qazKTDVAZZpMVU9R%0AUjZg%0A)

### Step 3: Add Securement Spots

Add any areas for securement that aren't blocked by seats. Click **Add Spot** for each one. Then add mobility devices that can be stored in these spots. Click **Add** for each device.

![Securement spot configuration](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1074423589/e048f334e0332e6363a941a6/Screenshot+2024-06-07+at+8_26_44%E2%80%AFAM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=47092b3e14d174f12879c0ac6dbfcc107d4c4208bb08385637fe08f9080eaf56&req=dSAgEs18noRXUPMW1HO4zZdZIS5a8yFwEwYC7QSQMuKluEQ32MB%2FrX0I6ulx%0AiBBS%0A)

If a rider can stay in their mobility device (like a wheelchair or scooter) for the whole trip, check the box that says _"rider can sit in this location at the same time as this accessibility feature"_.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1074412000/2162fc15b7d052b8b6da98e6/Screenshot+2024-06-07+at+8_11_11%E2%80%AFAM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=a5065cb2b79b14e7dfab33ea78b86d5a77b20f1b7b692b0a24deeb330bb27553&req=dSAgEs1%2Fn4FfWfMW1HO4zSkeMnzI2YAzaZqOYnr0OjKTI7Ha5lEIrW93UEok%0A6EQy%0A)

This step can be repeated for the other mobility devices that can be placed in this location.

Sometimes a securement location can store two types of mobility aid at the same time. For example, a single securement location may be able to accommodate:

- 1 rider in a wheelchair
- 1 rider in a scooter 
- 2 walkers
- 2 folding wheelchairs
- 1 walker and 1 folding wheelchair 

If two devices can share the spot, check the box that says _"Other types of accessibility features can be placed in this location at the same time if there's room"_. Do this for each feature that can share the spot. For this example, we'd need to enable it for folding wheelchairs and walkers.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1074658630/c9db4bfe1ee3ad173a2f780b/Screenshot+2024-06-07+at+8_31_37%E2%80%AFAM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=a0531852414303f94f1ddf9c7d1e3fbdae2ebbd83ea3d131c529ca4c91d093d8&req=dSAgEs97lYdcWfMW1HO4zQ1x2GxkXidUJbvN92FTosM1QHCgP2E7c46oqocu%0ARusX%0A)

## First in, last out (FILO) boarding

Some vehicles have seating arrangements that prevent riders from exiting the vehicle if another passenger with a mobility device is onboard. If **your vehicle type** faces this constraint, you can enable First In, Last Out (FILO) boarding on the vehicle type. Once enabled, Spare will adjust the manifests of all duties associated with a vehicle of this vehicle type to abide by this logic.

To enable First In, Last Out (FILO), check the boxes next to the accessibility features that require this order when boarding and unloading, then press **Save**. For example, if wheelchairs, oversized wheelchairs and walkers must be loaded and unloaded in the order they were boarded, check the boxes next to the name of each device.

If FILO is enabled for Wheelchairs, Oversized Wheelchairs, and Walkers, a duty picking up a Wheelchair first, then an Oversized Wheelchair, and then a Walker will unload the Walker first, then the Oversized Wheelchair, and finally the Wheelchair.

## Adding your Vehicle type to a New Vehicle

Next, you need to associate your vehicles to their corresponding vehicle type. When editing or creating a new vehicle you will notice a new field named **Capacity Type**. Here, you can choose between Legacy or Vehicle Type. If you select **Vehicle Type**, you are then able to choose the **Vehicle Type** of this Vehicle.

![Vehicle capacity type selection interface](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1074699975/32559908ea80d1f751c6be60/image.png?expires=1753820100&signature=ba59ebd443a1c08ec743cc3c5bae8d29b2a2ef1cc03cc9c575eeaf6c19bab70b&req=dSAgEs93lIhYXPMW1HO4zYOCg%2ByM4ZMWAAxCiKMhhxiqylfSy1Rg955uDvFX%0A1jmZ%0A)

For more information about legacy vehicle configuration, you can check out our [Legacy Accessibility Feature Configuration](/help-center/spare-operations-schedulers/schedulers-getting-started/legacy-adding-vehicle-accessibility-features) article.

Once you select your desired Capacity Type, you will then be able to see a summary of the capacity for riders and mobility aids.
