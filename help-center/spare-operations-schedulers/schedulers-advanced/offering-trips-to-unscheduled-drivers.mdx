Spare Engine decides who/when to send a trip offer to for unscheduled drivers based on various conditions. 

## Who to send to

The system sends a trip offer to the closest driver to the scheduled pickup location (considering none of the drivers have any trips at the moment).

Who receives the offer depends on the driver's location and manifest.

## Distance

Drivers need to be within 10 km + driving distance when the system dispatches a trip. 

For instance, if the driving distance for the trip is 8 km, the system sends the trip offer to whoever is within 18 km of the scheduled pickup location.

## When to dispatch a trip offer

If the trip duration is less than 15 minutes, the trip will be dispatched to a driver 15 minutes prior to the scheduled pickup time.  

If a trip duration is more than 15 minutes, the logic requires some quick math to explain:

**Dispatch time = scheduled pickup time - trip duration**

So, if the trip is 1 hour long and the scheduled pickup time is 12:00pm, the trip will be dispatched at 11:00 am. If there is no driver available at the time the trip is dispatched, the system will keep looking for an available driver until 10 minutes prior to the scheduled pickup time.

## Offer Duration

An offer is valid for **2 minutes**.

Drivers will have **30 seconds** to decide whether to accept or reject the trip.
