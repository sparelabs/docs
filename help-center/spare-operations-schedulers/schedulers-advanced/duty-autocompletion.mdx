If a duty is left in progress, Spare will automatically end the duty if certain conditions are met.

## Autocompletion Logic for Duties with a Scheduled End Time

When a duty has a scheduled end time and no trips are remaining, the auto-completion logic works as follows:

**Only End Location Slot Remaining:**

If only the end location slot is left, the duty will be marked as complete 1 minute after the requested end time.

Optionally, Spare can be configured so that the duty must be within 300 meters of the scheduled end location for auto-completion to occur. Please speak to your Spare Representative if you are interested in this configuration. 

**Dropoff Slots Remaining:**

If dropoff slots are also remaining and the duty is within 300 meters of the end location, the duty will be marked as complete 1 hour after the requested end time.

If the duty is not within 300 meters of the end location, the duty will be marked as complete 4 hours after the requested end time.

**Other Slots Remaining:**

If there are still slots remaining in the duty, such as pickups, the duty will not be auto-completed.

## Autocompletion Logic for Duties without a Scheduled End Time

For duties without a scheduled end time (excluding duties created in the last minute), the auto-completion logic is as follows:

**Driver Vehicle Location:**

If the driver has not posted a vehicle location, the duty will be marked as complete.

**Driver Offline Duration:**

If the driver has been offline for 10 minutes, the duty will be marked as complete.
