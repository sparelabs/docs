## About this featureForecasting provides transit agencies with insights into vehicle utilization. This tool forecasts the supply and demand throughout the day, helping agencies to optimize their duty schedules effectively by adjusting vehicle hours based on real-time needs. The forecasting feature is accessible under 'Shift Scheduling' in Spare 

Operations.

## How does it work?

The graph segments the vehicle activities by hour, showing:

**Idle Time**: Vehicle is stationary.

**Boarding Time**: Time spent on boarding or alighting passengers.

**Transporting Passengers**: Vehicle is in motion with one or more passengers onboard.

**Travelling Without Passengers**: Vehicle is moving without passengers.

**On Break**: Driver break periods.

**Unmatched Requests**: Total number of requests not assigned to a vehicle during that hour.

This graphical representation helps in planning both immediate and future needs.

You can customize the segments and fleets that are displayed on the graph using the filters at the top of the page:

## Current Capabilities

View upcoming hours and days to forecast and plan accordingly.

Note: It does not currently support viewing historical data.

## How can I use it to improve efficiency?Using the 

Forecasting feature, dispatchers and schedulers can enhance service efficiency for both the current and upcoming days:

**Add Vehicle Hours**: If forecasting shows many unmatched requests at a particular time, such as 5 PM tomorrow, adding more vehicle hours can ensure that these trips are completed on time.

**Reduce Vehicle Hours**: Conversely, a surplus of idle time suggests the potential to decrease duties, thus saving operational costs and enhancing the passengers per vehicle hour ratio.

Spare recommends maintaining a balanced schedule with some built-in idle time to accommodate unexpected events and ensure high on-time performance.

## Recent Improvements To ForecastingIn May 2024, we updated 

Forecasting to predict driver activities more accurately than its predecessor:

The previous version estimated supply and demand based on a basic comparison with historical data and historical productivity (passengers per vehicle hour). In this version, users would frequently see ‚Äúidle‚Äù time predicted even though the drivers were busy throughout the time window.

The new version uses detailed activity forecasts generated by Spare's Engine. This results in a more reliable, detailed and accurate forecast for the day.
