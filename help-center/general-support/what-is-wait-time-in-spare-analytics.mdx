<Info>
The Wait Time is visible in the Rider Experience section of Spare Analytics. Spare calculates the wait time for all 'Leave Now' and 'Leave As Soon As Possible' trips with a completed pickup.
</Info>

The wait time is defined as the time difference between the **completed pick-up time** and the **time when the rider is considered to be actively waiting** for their ride.

## How is this calculated?

The wait time calculation involves two key components:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Completed Pick-up Time" icon="clock">
    The time that the pickup was completed. Pickups can be completed by drivers in Spare's Driver Application or dispatchers in Spare Operations.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Active Waiting Time" icon="hourglass">
    The time when the rider is considered to be actively waiting for their ride (depends on several factors).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Determining Active Waiting Time

The **time when the rider is considered to be actively waiting** depends on these factors:

<Accordion title="Service Operating & No Walking Required">
  If the service is currently operating, and the rider does not need to walk to the pickup location, then the **active waiting time** is when the rider requested the trip.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Service Operating & Walking Required">
  If the service is currently operating, and the rider does need to walk to the pickup location, then the **active waiting time** is when they will reach the pickup location.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Service Not Operating">
  If the service is not operating, then the **active waiting time** is when the service starts operating.
</Accordion>

<Warning>
Spare only calculates the Wait Time for **Leave Now** and **Leave As Soon As Possible** trips. Wait time is not calculated for **recurring trips**, **scheduled leave-at**, and **scheduled arrive-by** trips.
</Warning>
