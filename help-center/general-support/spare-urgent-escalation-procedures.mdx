<Info>
**Need Urgent Help â€” But It's Not a Disruption?**

If you're not seeing a platform-wide issue, but you still need **urgent support**, you can contact us via **chat**. Our team is available **24/7** and will assist you right away. If the chat agent determines the issue is in fact a service disruption, they'll escalate it accordingly.
</Info>

## What Qualifies as an Urgent Escalation?

Urgent escalations should only be made for **service disruptions** that significantly impact your operations.

<Warning>
Only use the urgent escalation process for genuine service disruptions. For other urgent matters, use our regular support channels.
