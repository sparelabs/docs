## What Are Location Notes?

Pickup and Dropoff Location notes allow riders and admins to add specific messages for drivers. This optional feature streamlines communication and improves clarity for drivers, ensuring smoother daily operations for everyone.

<Info>
Location notes are especially helpful for providing specific instructions about building entrances, parking locations, or other important details that help drivers locate passengers efficiently.

**Smart Auto-Population:** If a rider is traveling to or from one of their favorite locations that has a saved note, the default note will automatically populate during trip creation, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Rider App Functionality

Riders have full control over location notes directly from their mobile app.

#### Adding Notes During Booking

### Driver App Experience

Drivers can view notes left by either admins or riders, with smart display formatting based on note length.

#### Short Notes Display

For brief notes, the full text displays directly in the driver's interface without requiring additional interaction.

## Frequently Asked Questions

  <Accordion title="How do admins view and modify Location Notes for Favorite Locations?">
    Admins can **create** and **edit** Favorite Locations by:
    1. Navigating to the rider's profile
    2. Clicking into **Preferences**
    3. Adding or editing that rider's **Favorite Locations**
    
    This allows admins to help riders set up commonly used locations with appropriate notes.
