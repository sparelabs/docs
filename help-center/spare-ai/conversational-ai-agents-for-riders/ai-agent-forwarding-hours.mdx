# Overview

Configure the hours when your AI agent can forward calls to the human call center. When riders request to speak to a human outside these hours, the AI will inform them that the call center is closed and provide information about when they can next reach human support.

## How It Works

<Callout type="info">
When a rider requests human assistance outside forwarding hours, the AI will politely explain that the call center is closed and provide the next available time for human support.
</Callout>

This feature ensures riders have clear expectations about when human support is available while allowing the AI to continue handling requests during off-hours.

## Setup Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Forwarding Hours">
    Navigate to **Settings → Advanced → Agent Forwarding Hours**
    
    Here you can:
    - Set the hours when the forwarding line is open
    - Configure special holiday schedules when the call center may be closed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Apply Hours to AI Agent">
    When creating or editing an AI Agent:
    1. Scroll to the bottom of the agent configuration
    2. Select the forwarding hours you created in the previous step
    3. Save your agent configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>
