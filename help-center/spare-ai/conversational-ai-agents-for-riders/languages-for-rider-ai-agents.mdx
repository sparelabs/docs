AI Voice agents at Spare can either be set up to speak a specific language, or set to multilingual, allowing the agent to switch between multiple languages during a single call.

<Info>
If the agent is set to multilingual, it will be able to change between languages mid-conversation. However, the intro message will be preset with chosen text (e.g., limited to 1 or 2 languages).
