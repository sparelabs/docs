Authentication (set with `Authentication Type`) is required for every phone call and relates to the method by which the agent identifies the rider successfully.

<Info>
Authentication for AI Chat (SMS) is always done based on the rider's phone number only.
</Info>

## What happens without successful authentication?

Without successful authentication, the AI agent will not be able to perform any actions, and will either:

  <Card title="Registration Request" icon="user-plus">
    Ask the rider to register (if rider registration is enabled)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Forward to Support" icon="phone-arrow-up-right">
    Forward the rider to the forwarding number
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Available Authentication Methods

### Phone Number Authentication

<Card title="Primary Authentication Method" icon="phone">
  The primary method of authenticating riders with our agents is via their phone number. The rider must be calling from a number which is attached to a rider profile.
</Card>

<Note>
If they are not calling from a number attached to a rider profile, they will either be forwarded to support or asked to register a profile (if the agent has rider registration capability enabled).
</Note>

### Phone Number with Rider ID + PIN as Backup

#### Prerequisites

<Warning>
In order to use Rider ID and PIN Authentication, your organization must have Rider IDs enabled and populated for your riders.
</Warning>

<Info>
Rider ID and PIN is currently supported by AI Voice but is not supported by AI Chat.
</Info>

#### How it works

This authentication type involves the same steps as phone authentication. However, if no phone number is present, then there is a backup authentication method, which involves their rider ID + a PIN number. The PIN number is set up on their first AI voice call.

<Tip>
We suggest this option comes with communication to riders about the process.
</Tip>

This option also works well for rider representatives, as the rider is asked if they are calling on behalf of themselves, or someone else.

The conversation flow for this is shown below:

### Phone Number with Rider ID + Custom Field (Date of Birth) as Backup

#### Prerequisites

<Warning>
In order to use Rider ID and Custom Field Authentication, your organization must have Rider IDs enabled and populated for your riders.
</Warning>

<Info>
Rider ID and Custom Field authentication is currently supported by AI Voice but is not supported by AI Chat.
</Info>

#### How it works

This authentication type involves the same steps as phone authentication. However, if no phone number is present, then there is a backup authentication method, which involves their rider ID + the rider's Date of Birth, or any other date custom field on a rider profile.

<Tip>
This option also works well for rider representatives, as the rider is asked if they are calling on behalf of themselves, or someone else.
