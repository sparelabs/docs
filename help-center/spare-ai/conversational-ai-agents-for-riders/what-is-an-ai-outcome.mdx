# Overview

An outcome is measured as a successfully performed action by the AI agent. Outcomes help track the effectiveness and usage of your AI agents.

## Types of AI Outcomes

The AI agent can currently achieve the following outcomes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Trip Management">
    - Check an ETA of a trip
    - Cancel a trip
    - Book a trip
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Services">
    - Add a payment method
    - Leave a rider review
    - Rider registration
    - Check status of eligibility application
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
More outcome types are continuously being added to expand AI agent capabilities.

## Outcome Counting Rules

Understanding how outcomes are counted is important for accurately measuring AI agent performance:

<Accordion title="Multiple Outcomes Per Call">
Multiple outcomes can occur within a single call. For example, if a rider asks for an ETA check and then books a trip shortly after, this counts as **2 outcomes**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Trip Cancellations">
When a rider cancels a trip, the AI typically reads out upcoming trips to confirm which one to cancel. This interaction counts as **2 outcomes**:
1. Reading the trip list
2. Canceling the selected trip
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multiple Actions">
Riders can perform multiple actions of the same type per call:
- Canceling multiple rides = one outcome per ride canceled
- Booking multiple rides = one outcome per ride booked
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ETA Check Clarifications">
Each time the AI performs an ETA check, it counts as a separate outcome, even if the rider asks for clarification or requests the same ETA multiple times.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Single Trip, Multiple Details">
If a rider requests an ETA check and the AI reads out multiple trips in response, this counts as only **1 outcome**.
</Accordion>

<Warning>
Calls containing outcomes can still be transferred to a Customer Service Representative (CSR). This transfer capability sometimes causes confusion when analyzing AI voice data, as successful outcomes may still result in human handoffs.
</Warning>
