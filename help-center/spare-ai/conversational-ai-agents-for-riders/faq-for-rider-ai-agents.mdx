Welcome to our FAQ page! Here you will find answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about AI Voice & Chat.

## Language Support

<Accordion title="What languages does AI Voice & Chat support?">
AI Voice & Chat currently supports a variety of languages.

For a complete list of supported languages, please see our [supporting documentation](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/11564587-languages-for-rider-ai-agents).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can additional languages be added to AI Voice?">

</Accordion>

## Location and Trip Management

<Accordion title="Does AI know about favorite locations?">
Yes, AI Voice & Chat will automatically recognize a rider's favorite locations. This means riders can simply say "I'd like a trip home from 123 Main Street" and the AI will understand and process the request.
</Accordion>

## Payment Handling

<Accordion title="How does AI Voice handle payments?">
AI Voice agents will confirm existing payment methods that the rider has on file. If no payment methods are available for a booking, the AI agent will:

1. Transfer the call to a secure line
2. Allow the rider to enter their card details safely
3. Transfer the call back to the AI agent to complete the booking

This ensures secure payment processing while maintaining a smooth booking experience.

## Customization

<Accordion title="Can I teach the AI special terms or pronunciations?">
Yes, with English-language agents, you can specify the pronunciation of key phrases and terms. Please reach out to your Partner Success Manager to set up custom pronunciations for your specific use case.
</Accordion>

## AI Chat Integration

<Accordion title="How does AI Chat work with Responsive SMS?">
<Warning>
AI Chat replaces Responsive SMS, and the two systems are not compatible.
</Warning>

If you have previously been using Responsive SMS, you will need to switch to AI Chat to continue using our AI services. The migration ensures you get the latest AI capabilities and improvements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does AI Chat handle language and channel preferences?">
Currently, AI Chat can be used in conjunction with language and channel preferences, but is only available over SMS. 

**Important considerations:**
- All users can text the AI Chat phone number and receive responses
- Users who have set their channel preference to non-SMS modes will not receive SMS notifications
- As a result, these notifications will not be available to AI Chat for those users

This limitation affects notification delivery but not the core AI Chat functionality.
