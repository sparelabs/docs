title: "AI Agents for Riders: AI Voice & Chat"
description: "Handle rider support over the phone or SMS with automated AI agents, including bookings, cancellations, ETAs and more."
---

Every rider has their own favorite way to book or check on a ride. In many services, riders would prefer to call into a contact center. It can be difficult to always provide a high-quality experience in the call center due to capacity constraints and high peak call volumes.

<Info>
AI agents for riders are conversational agents that use the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to bring contact center hold times to zero â€” reducing the barrier to access transit.
</Info>

These agents are available via SMS (AI Chat) and phone (AI Voice).

### Required Configuration Fields

To create a new AI Agent you will need to include:

<Accordion title="Basic Information">
  - **Name**: The name of the agent for internal purposes. The agent name will not be provided to people calling the agent.
  - **Description**: The description of the agent for internal purposes. The agent description will not be provided to people calling the agent.
  - **Introduction Message**: A short message that the AI Voice Agent will read in advance of explaining what it can do.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent Capabilities">
  **Agent Capabilities**: What would you like this agent to do? Currently the agent can do either:
  - `Trip Booking, ETA, and Cancellation`
  - `Only Trip ETA and Cancellation`
  
  Additionally, the agent can manage Eligibility cases if `Eligibility` is selected.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="FAQ Content">
  **FAQ Content**: Basic questions and information that the AI Voice Agent can communicate to the riders. If you have a standard FAQ about how your services work, place it here. 
  
  Read about common FAQ content [here](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/11565177-faq-for-rider-ai-agents).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Voice-Specific Configuration">
  - **Voice Selection**: AI Voice can leverage one of many different voices. Select the voice that meets your needs.
  - **Voice Speed**: Determines how fast AI Voice speaks. The default is `1.0`. To make AI Voice speak slower, use a number less than 1.0.
  - **Authentication Type**: There are two ways to authenticate users, either by the phone number calling in, or by a rider ID and pin. [Read more about authentication](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/11564614-authenticating-rider-agents).
  - **Language**: AI Voice agents can converse in a wide variety of languages. [See supporting documentation](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/11564587-languages-for-rider-ai-agents).
  - **Forwarding Number**: If AI Voice identifies challenges with communication on the call, it may ask the user calling in whether they would like to talk to a live agent. AI Voice will automatically transfer the call to the forwarding number when the rider confirms or asks for a live agent.
  - **Default**: While there can be multiple agents for an organization, only one agent can answer the call when a user calls in. When Default is set to true, the agent will always be the one that answers the call. Organizations can only have one default agent.
</Accordion>

## What is AI Chat?

![AI Chat interface showing text conversation with AI agent](/images/spare-ai/conversational-ai-agents/spare-ai-chat-interface.png)

AI Chat enables you to provide the same AI Agent that is used in AI Voice, but over SMS text on your existing phone number used for SMS notifications. The functionality and capabilities of AI Chat are the same as AI Voice.

## How to enable AI Chat

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact Your PSM">
    AI Chat can be easily turned on by your PSM. Reach out to get this enabled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update SMS Notifications">
    Update your SMS notifications to explain that riders can respond to messages.
    
    **Example**: Instead of "Your trip is confirmed.", update to say "Your trip is confirmed. You can chat with me here to get any updates on your trip or book and cancel upcoming trips."
  </Step>
