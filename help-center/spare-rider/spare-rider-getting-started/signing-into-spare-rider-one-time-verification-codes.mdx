## How do I get a Verification Code?

To start using the app, you will need a one-time verification code sent as a **text message or via a voice call to your cell phone**. 

### Step 1: Type in your cell phone number

First, type in your cell phone number and click **"Confirm"**.

### Step 2: Insert the code

Select your preference: receive a text message or a voice call, and insert the 5-digit code. Click **Confirm** to get to the main menu of the Rider App.

<Info>
The code is valid for **5 minutes**. If you need to **request a one-time verification code again**, **go back** to the previous menu by clicking the top left arrow, check your phone number, and click "Confirm". You will only need to insert the code again if you log out of your account or delete and reinstall the Application.

## How do I receive the code by phone call?

5-6% of Americans either only use a landline or rely heavily on a landline for communication. This is a percentage of riders that can't receive verification codes via SMS and therefore could not use our self-serve booking options. This feature opens up the Rider App and more importantly Rider Web to them.

<Warning>
Ask your Spare Representative to ensure that this feature is enabled for your organization, as it requires connecting a phone number to call with these codes.
</Warning>

Once set up, it will look something like this for riders:

## I requested the code but didn't receive it. What should I do?

There may be several reasons why you did not receive the code. We recommend checking each of them in the following order:

### There is a typo in your cell phone number

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- If you already have a profile, confirm that your contact number is listed correctly. Contact a service representative if you need to update the information.
- If you are a first-time user, confirm you typed in the correct cell phone number.

### Your phone has a poor mobile network connection

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Turn Airplane/Do Not Disturb Mode on and off
- Restart your device
- Move to a different place with a stronger signal

### Your cell phone carrier autoblocks verification codes

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Check if you can receive any other verification codes (e.g., from your bank or a social network)
- Contact your cell phone carrier for further troubleshooting

### The verification messages are blocked on your phone

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Go to your phone settings and select Messages. Check the Blocked and Spam sections

## I tried all the troubleshooting steps above but still didn't receive a code. What do I do next?
