## How It Works

### Set up Rider Representatives in Spare Operations

Transit staff can assign authorized representatives and link them to specific riders through the admin panel in Spare Operations. This access is not managed by riders themselves.

### How to Book and Manage Rides on Behalf of Another Rider

When an authorized representative logs in, they'll see a new section at the bottom of their profile with:

- **Authorized Representatives** – people who can book for this rider
- **Riders Represented** – people this rider is authorized to book for

#### Representative Books a Trip

From the home screen, the representative taps **Where to** and is prompted to choose which rider they're booking for.

#### Trip Confirmation and Tracking

Once the trip is confirmed, the representative can view and manage the trip along with all other trips booked for other riders in one view.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who can be a representative?

Representatives are individuals or organizations (such as care homes or hospitals) manually assigned by the agency through Spare Launch. Riders cannot assign representatives themselves.

### Can representatives use the rider's payment method?

No. Only the representative's payment methods are available during booking. The represented rider's stored payment options cannot be used.

### Which payment methods are supported?

At this time, only onboard payment methods like cash are supported for trips booked by a representative.

### Who receives trip notifications?

Both the rider and the representative receive trip notifications.

### Can representatives see past and upcoming trips?

Yes. All authorized representatives can view the full trip history and schedule for the riders they represent.

### Can multiple representatives manage the same rider?

Yes. When a rider has multiple representatives, each representative can see all trips booked—regardless of who booked them.

### Can agencies track who booked a trip?

Not yet. Trips booked by representatives appear in Spare Operations as standard Rider App bookings, without showing which representative initiated the booking.
