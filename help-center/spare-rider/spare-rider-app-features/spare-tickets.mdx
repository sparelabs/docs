## What are Spare Tickets?

Tickets is a payment method type that you can enable for your riders to purchase and validate tickets from the Spare Rider App.

This is especially useful if your riders will be transferring between services and need to show a ticket to multiple different drivers.

## How Can I Set Up Tickets?

<Info>
**Prerequisites**: You must have access to Spare Operations and appropriate permissions to configure payment methods.
</Info>

In Spare Operations, head to "Spare Pay" and then "Payment Method Types".

![Spare Pay navigation screen showing Payment Method Types option](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/wyxobwoi/1242412745/d899b4447b8bcc5f965f9e667dfd/Screenshot+2024-11-06+at+1_25_27%E2%80%AFPM+%282%29.png?expires=1753820100&signature=ead994d446cb0257e68e92601f441ebe3ff4214a17ec0c7175282fa90aaf4eb8&req=dSIjFM1%2Fn4ZbXPMW1HO4zacrJZBwMk5apH0OGgO6lfLlcQfFfbwnPXi4WxNe%0AUDLd%0A)

From here, add a Payment Method Type. Make sure the "Payment Provider" is "None" and the "Configuration Type" is "Ticket". Now, you'll be able to fill in the following details:

### Configuration Details

#### Type

These can be anything. Most commonly, agencies use this to differentiate between different zones or areas that service is offered.

#### Fare

This is where you can define the type of fare the rider will use this ticket for - is it a single trip? A weekly pass? Choose between "Duration" if you want the ticket to last X minutes after it's activated or choose "Calendar" if you want the ticket to expire at the end of a day, week, or month.

#### Rider

This is where you can define the different riders who will purchase tickets. Do you want to differentiate between Adults and Children? Do so here. 

Once all of these are added, you can adjust pricing for each one in the table automatically generated at the bottom of your screen.

<Warning>
Once saved, make sure that you've added this new Payment Method Type to the appropriate Service so that riders can use Tickets to pay rides on that Service.
</Warning>

## What Does it Look Like for Riders?

From the home screen, riders can click on the account button in the top left to access this menu. Then, they'll select "Tickets":

![Spare Rider App tickets menu showing purchased and available tickets](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/wyxobwoi/1242418171/291ea27637b99b497da9b271cba4/Screenshot+2024-11-06+at+1_26_57%E2%80%AFPM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=4cc13b42eb547d1432e9d9f20cf8507cb367aae5960a19b0706a894598dbeddb&req=dSIjFM1%2FlYBYWPMW1HO4zfC5zypFr1zs2TsFWsqJ0rgvG7LNGNLCye2o1Yb8%0APDg4%0A)

This is where riders can purchase tickets, see already purchased ones, or check on expired ones. Let's buy a new one:

### Purchasing a Ticket

![Ticket purchase screen showing available ticket options](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/wyxobwoi/1242418898/c66e4e0eab0fee2fad61f438b739/Screenshot+2024-11-06+at+1_27_07%E2%80%AFPM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=f17aa8bfe671f96402819c87501b361ff2eeed17b415c519be59b741f5560a9b&req=dSIjFM1%2FlYlWUfMW1HO4zTOZh1UIiHLeWicrdzb4VAjPf7xGKfEfyS2jP7Qs%0AziQB%0A)

Here's where your configuration from earlier comes in! Riders will now select the Type, Fare, and Rider that they need for this ticket.

![Ticket configuration selection screen showing Type, Fare, and Rider options](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/wyxobwoi/1242419399/376048ca35007f0a5bae10918649/Screenshot+2024-11-06+at+1_27_15%E2%80%AFPM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=3a6540f1210987c13bf8181259d41fa954ffbc9159a3a5ae593e3224dc46f629&req=dSIjFM1%2FlIJWUPMW1HO4zd5NDqG0c8Zoc3WI%2B7ok%2Bd6jXLei3F6R2Z68RvTI%0AhUGP%0A)

Once selected, riders can purchase this ticket with the payment method of their choice:

And now it's ready to be activated when boarding a vehicle!

### Activating a Ticket

![Purchased ticket ready for activation with details displayed](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/wyxobwoi/1242420890/34c305da5d21484326d8a9bc74bd/Screenshot+2024-11-06+at+1_28_32%E2%80%AFPM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=58de3b178c185c336e5771a66f045db61444941b070f69d6a2abf654983753dc&req=dSIjFM18nYlWWfMW1HO4zcEoG98VL6xaJib9aMR9ouTQ9uIPuExQjy5%2BAQmS%0ATYYN%0A)

Before activating, the rider can see when the ticket will expire:

When it's activated, there's a moving animation to show the driver that this ticket is valid:

## Using Tickets for Trip Booking

When a rider is booking a trip, they can select "Ticket" as their payment method:

![Trip booking screen showing Ticket payment option](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/wyxobwoi/1242422182/2371bfd61341734e13bb12776626/Screenshot+2024-11-06+at+1_29_43%E2%80%AFPM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=d889e6f8e4ea062b630f81358084e8cb08822925bf4880c5fdf7fa30afacf017&req=dSIjFM18n4BXW%2FMW1HO4zfBBqOtxEcK4jxtxXGl4qTp5GdQ6d372XwyCtW7W%0AkA%2BY%0A)

And then when their vehicle is arriving, they'll see "My Tickets" in the top right hand side of the screen so they can easily access this and show it to the driver when boarding:

![Vehicle arrival screen showing My Tickets access button](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/wyxobwoi/1242422680/8371f7103f10b1a526e90d772319/Screenshot+2024-11-06+at+1_30_04%E2%80%AFPM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=043d371b140419549dd1ec720e18c0cf8a2119b4792bd3f4ef6ee66dfc71b5ac&req=dSIjFM18n4dXWfMW1HO4zR0jCwl1XMhNlVc0rlT0ijk7eVQtJO72G4UncOn7%0AnvG4%0A)

<Tip>
Riders can easily access their tickets when their vehicle arrives by tapping "My Tickets" in the top right corner of the screen during pickup.
