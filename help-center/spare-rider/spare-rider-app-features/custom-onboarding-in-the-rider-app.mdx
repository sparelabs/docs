Your service is unique, and so the first experience for your riders should showcase that! With our new customer onboarding feature, now you can. 

## How do I set up a custom Rider Guide?

In Spare Operations, head to: Settings > General > Rider Interface and scroll down to **Rider Guide**

- Once there, you can edit the existing onboarding flow, add new steps, and reorder the flow itself. 

## What images can I use in the Rider Guide? 

Choose from our library of existing images, or simply upload your own!

## What about if my organization supports multiple languages?

Under Settings > General > Organization, you'll find the ability to edit rider notifications. Here, you can specify which languages your organization supports and add new ones. Any languages found in this list can be configured in your Rider Guide. 

Then, if the rider's device language is set to that language, this text will show. 

## When do riders access the Rider Guide?

By default, riders will see the Rider Guide the first time they download and access the app. Then, it can be accessed in the future by clicking on the Account button in the top left corner of the home screen, scrolling to Help and clicking Rider Guide.
