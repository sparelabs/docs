Riders of Spare-powered services often plan their trips in advance and/or book in bunches. Trip to the grocery store, then back home. Or a trip to the doctor’s, then the nail salon, then back home. Prior to this feature, you’d have to book each of those trips individually, which felt quite tedious.

## How to use this feature

After booking your initial trip, you'll see options to add additional trips to your journey:

## Important considerations

<Info>
The multiple trips feature only appears if your trip is scheduled in advance, meaning trips that are booked as a "Leave At" or "Arrive By" and are more than 30 minutes in the future.

<Note>
As of an update in May 2024, details from your original trip will carry over to the return trip or next trip. These include accessibility features, rider types, and payment methods.
