## Rider Web Definition and Value

### What is Rider Web?

Spare Rider Web is the browser version of the Whitelabeled Spare Rider App (available on the App Store and Google Play Store). Spare Rider Web has the same functionality as Spare Rider App.

The interface is currently supported in the following languages:

- English
- French
- German
- Japanese
- Norwegian
- Spanish
- Swedish
- Catalan
- Icelandic
- Portuguese

## What is the value, and how is it different from Spare Rider App?

As Spare Rider App, Spare Rider Web allows riders to book trips for themselves. However, it doesn't require any app download and can be accessed from any browser on a user's desktop or mobile device.

Spare Rider Web is especially beneficial for not-so-tech-savvy riders or those who don't have access to smartphones on daily basis.

Please note that Spare Rider Web does not allow booking on somebody else's behalf and requires a one-time passcode (text message) as a phone number authentication.

Up until now there have been only two (default) ways to book trips on Spare powered services:

1. By downloading a whitelabeled app onto your smartphone and book for yourself
2. By calling in to a call center and having a booking agent book on your behalf

Rider Web adds a third option to book trips:

3. By accessing Rider Web from a web browser on your desktop or mobile phone and booking for yourself

With Rider Web, we have opened up the option for those without smartphones, but with a cell phone ([12% of the American population](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/)), to book trips without calling into a call center. Rider Web still, however, uses [SMS to authenticate](https://www.notion.so/Why-we-require-authentication-on-Rider-Web-be575bd077b94280b1214080db518574?pvs=21) a rider’s profile. As [97% of Americans have a cell phone](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/), 3% of riders will still need to book using a call center. There is, however, the possibility that some of these 3% of riders can still receive texts to a landline, as many landline operators provide “[Text to Landline](https://www.verizon.com/support/text-to-landline-faqs/)” functionality.

To enable Rider Web and get it set up for your organization, please reach out to your Partner Success Manager.

## How do I sign into Rider Web?

Spare Rider Web and Spare Rider require **phone number based authentication**. This is not 2FA, but rather a one-time passcode sent to a phone number.

## What does Rider Web not do?

The focus of Rider Web is to provide an experience for a single rider, accessible on the web / any browser. It is not to enable a concierge booking experience on behalf of another rider.
