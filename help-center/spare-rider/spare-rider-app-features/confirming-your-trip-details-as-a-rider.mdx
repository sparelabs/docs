The Trip Timeline improvement is a feature designed to enhance the visibility and management of transit trips within the Spare platform. This feature provides users with an improved visual representation of their journey, pre- and post-confirmation.

## Background

We noticed that riders were often cancelling trips very quickly after booking. Prior to this change, more information about the journey was available *post-confirmation* and so riders would book, check that information, and then cancel if they didn't like it.

This could lead to higher cancellation rates for your agency, and is a frustrating experience for riders who would spend more time booking trips than necessary. Trip Timelines brings all the important info about a rider's journey into a consistent view, shown prior to and post confirmation.

## What does it look like?

There are many types of trips a rider can book and [ways for agencies to configure](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8988085-service-general-setup) which trips are available. 

Here are some examples using particular settings:
