5. **Add Favourite Locations**

   There are a few options for creating a new Favourite Location. You can:

   - Search for a favourite location
   - Set a location on the map
   - Select your current location
   - Choose from a previous destination you have entered (these are listed with the light orange flag icons on the left)

   After you have selected the Favourite Location, you may choose an icon which matches that location. Click the **Confirm** button to ensure your Favourite Location is added to the app.

   Once you select "Confirm", you will be taken back to the screen which displays all of your Favourite Locations. If you want to add another Favourite Location, simply press the "Add Favourite" button again.
