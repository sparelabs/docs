It's common to offer both same-day and scheduled trips. However, riders are habitual and will often do one or the other. This article explains how Spare has optimized both of these flows, so that riders can book in a way that's convenient to them.

<Info>
The booking options available to you depend on how your service administrator has configured the home screen trip mode for your service.
</Info> 

## Home Screen Trip Mode Configuration

Your service administrator can configure which booking options appear on your home screen based on your service's operational model:

### Available Trip Mode Options

Depending on your service configuration, you may see one of the following booking interfaces:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Scheduled and Leave Now">
    **Full Booking Options Available**
    
    You'll see both immediate and scheduled booking options on your home screen:
    
    ![Rider app home screen showing both "Where to?" and "Schedule" options](/images/spare-rider/scheduling/home-screen-options.png)
    
    This configuration provides maximum flexibility for riders who need both immediate and advance booking capabilities.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Scheduled Only">
    **Advance Booking Required**
    
    Your home screen will only show scheduled booking options. All trips must be booked in advance:
    
    - You'll be required to select a future time and date for your trip
    - Immediate "leave now" booking is not available
    - This is common for paratransit services and fixed-route operations
    
    <Note>
    If you only see scheduled booking options, your service requires advance planning for all trips. Contact your transportation provider if you need immediate trip assistance.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Leave Now Only">
    **Immediate Booking Only**
    
    Your home screen will focus on immediate booking:
    
    - You'll see the "Where to?" option for immediate trip requests
    - Scheduled booking for future trips is not available
    - This is typical for on-demand ride services
    
    <Tip>
    Services configured for "leave now only" prioritize immediate availability and quick response times.
    </Tip>

</Tabs>

## How the Booking Flows Work

Depending on your service's configuration, you'll have access to different booking flows:

### Immediate Trip Booking ("Where to?")

When available, immediate booking:
- Takes you directly to destination entry
- Your current location is pre-filled as the origin
- Optimized for same-day travel
- Provides the fastest booking experience

### Scheduled Trip Booking ("Schedule")

When available, scheduled booking:
- Starts with time and date selection
- Requires manual entry of both origin and destination  
- Optimized for advance planning
- Allows you to book trips for future dates and times

### Enhanced Time Selection Interface

When scheduling trips in advance, you'll see improved time selection options:

- **Now**: Book for immediate departure (if enabled)
- **Leave At**: Specify when you want to be picked up
- **Arrive By**: Specify when you need to arrive at your destination
