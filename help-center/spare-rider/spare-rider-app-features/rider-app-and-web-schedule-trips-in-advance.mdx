description: "Learn how riders can schedule trips in advance with optimized flows for both immediate and future travel needs"

It's common to offer both same-day and scheduled trips. However, riders are habitual and will often do one or the other. This article explains how Spare has optimized both of these flows, so that riders can book in a way that's convenient to them.

This feature must be enabled by your Spare Representative to become available to your riders.

## What has changed?

In the past, you had to choose for *all* or *no* riders to automatically see the time and date selection page before scheduling a trip. 

This is an unnecessary step for riders looking for a trip now, but a critical one for those scheduling in advance. 

## How it works

Once this feature is enabled by your Spare Representative, your riders will see the following interface changes:

### Two booking flows

On the home screen, riders can choose between two optimized booking flows:

**Immediate trips ("Where to?"):**
- Takes riders directly to destination entry
- Origin is pre-filled with the rider's current location
- Optimized for same-day travel

**Scheduled trips ("Schedule"):**
- Starts with time and date selection
- Requires manual entry of both origin and destination
- Optimized for advance planning

### Improved time selection

UI updates were made to the "choose a time" page, with the intention of making it easier to choose between Now, Leave At, and Arrive By.

### Origin field improvements

In both flows, when the rider confirms their origin, the design was adjusted to make it clearer to the rider that this field can be re-edited.

<Tip>
Riders can always modify their origin location even after initial confirmation, providing flexibility throughout the booking process.
