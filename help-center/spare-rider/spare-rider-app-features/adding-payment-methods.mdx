To make sure your journey is hassle-free, Spare offers flexible payment options. In this article, we'll guide you through the steps to set up and manage different payment methods in Spare Rider App.

## Available Payment Methods

There are several ways riders can pay for their trip:

### By Cash
When riders choose to pay onboard the vehicle, the "Ticket" or "Cash" option should be selected while booking.

### By Card
Alternatively, riders can opt to pay for their rides using a credit/debit card. If they select this option, they'll need to add your credit card details to the app.

### Custom Payment Methods
If you create custom payment methods in Spare Pay, riders can choose them when they request a ride. These payment methods are not in the app's payments section.

## Selecting a Payment Method During Booking

1. Launch the app and enter your ride details.

2. Tap the payment icon on the bottom right corner of the screen.
