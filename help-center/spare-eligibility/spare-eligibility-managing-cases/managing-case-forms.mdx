## Viewing the Forms to Complete

To view the forms required to be completed within a certain case:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Cases">
    Go to the **Cases** tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Your Case">
    Search for a specific **case record** (apply filters, if necessary)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Case Details">
    Open the **case information page**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Case Forms">
    Scroll down to the **Case Forms** section
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If the section says "No results found", it means that there are currently no forms associated with the case type. To change that, go to the case template and add a new form.
</Warning>

### Form Information Display

If there are forms to be completed as part of the process, you will see:

- **Form name**
- **Number of completed required fields** *(e.g., "Required Fields: 0 out of 3" indicates that none of the required fields have been completed)*
- **Time the form was last updated**
