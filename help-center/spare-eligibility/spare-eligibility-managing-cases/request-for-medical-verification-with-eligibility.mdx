## What is Request for Medical Verification?

Request for Medical Verification enables agencies to create an Eligibility Case Form that can be sent to medical professionals by the agency or the rider to securely collect the rider's medical information digitally.

An important part of the eligibility process is verifying a rider's disability claim by a medical professional. As the applicant's healthcare provider, they are uniquely qualified to clarify the rider's functional abilities and limitations to ride the fixed route service. 

<Callout type="note">
  Depending on the agency's eligibility process, the verification can be carried out by the agency or it's the rider's responsibility to ensure that their healthcare provider provides the information necessary to continue their eligibility application process. Either way, this step is almost always required before an agency can review and determine the eligibility of a rider.

## What is the Value?

The existing procedure is excessively manual, reliant on paper, and poses security concerns for riders, agencies, and medical professionals. Currently, riders must print out the form and visit their healthcare provider in person to fulfill this step.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="Can a Medical Verification form be shared before a Rider Case is created?">
  No, as there isn't an existing Case form that the Medical form can be associated with, it cannot be sent to a medical professional beforehand.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How will the Medical Professional identify who the rider is?">
  Currently, it is the Agency or the Rider's responsibility to share the Rider details with the Medical professional when they share the Form link. Automated notifications in the future can help alleviate this friction.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I link to a Specialist form?">
  You can reference a Specialist form using one of these URL formats, depending on the hub:

  **Rider Hub Forms:**
  ```
  https://my.sparelabs.com/forms?organizationId=<organizationId>&caseTypeKey=<caseTypeKey>&formKey=<formKey>&caseId=<caseId>
  ```

  **Older Forms:**
  ```
  https://forms.sparelabs.com/forms?organizationId=<organizationId>&caseTypeKey=<caseTypeKey>&formKey=<formKey>&caseId=<caseId>
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What fields do I need to include in the URL?">
  You'll need to specify the following fields:

  - `organizationId`
  - `caseTypeKey`
  - `formKey`
  - `caseId`

  These can either be automatically generated within your workflow or configured beforehand.

  **Example of automatic generation within a workflow:**
  - `organizationId` → `#{{trigger.organizationId}}`
  - `caseId` → `#{{trigger.objectId}}`

  **Full URL example:**
  For a case with key `StepB` and form with key `SectionB`, the URL would be:
  ```
  https://my.sparelabs.com/forms?organizationId=#{{trigger.organizationId}}&caseTypeKey=StepB&formKey=SectionB&caseId=#{{trigger.objectId}}
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there any important things to know about these links?">
  Yes, there are two key points:

  **Case Creation:** The form accessible via this link will only be generated and available *after* the corresponding case has been created.

  **User Access:** Users who are logged into the hub will *not* be able to access the form using this link.
