AI Scan allows you to digitize handwritten forms and automatically import data into Eligibility Cases for any Case Forms. This powerful feature uses advanced optical character recognition (OCR) technology to extract information from scanned documents and populate form fields with confidence scores, significantly reducing manual data entry time.

<Note>
AI Scan works with various document formats and handwriting styles, but performance may vary based on document quality and legibility.

## How to Use AI Scan

AI Scan can be used to import data in an Eligibility Case for any Case Forms. You might need to [create a new case](/help-center/spare-eligibility/spare-eligibility-managing-cases/creating-a-new-case) for a rider if it doesn't exist.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Case Form">
    Navigate to the Case Form where you want to import scanned data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Upload Your Document">
    Once you're in a Case Form, click the **Scan document** button to upload your files.
