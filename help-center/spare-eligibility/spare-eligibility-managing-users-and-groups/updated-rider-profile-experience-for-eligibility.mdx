## Key Improvements

The redesigned rider profile experience delivers several enhancements to streamline your workflow:

### Enhanced Access to Rider Information

The new interface provides consolidated access to all rider-related information in a single, organized view:

- **Cases**: View and manage all rider cases
- **Group Memberships**: Access membership details and assignments
- **Preferences**: Review rider preferences and settings
- **Activity Log**: Track all rider-related activities and changes

### Reduced Navigation Complexity

<Tip>
The primary objective of this update is to minimize scrolling and reduce the number of tabs and windows you need to keep open while managing rider profiles.
