description: "Learn how to format case letter templates using Markdown syntax and the built-in formatting toolbar in Spare Eligibility."

Spare Eligibility allows you to create document templates with custom content and formatting called Template Letters. 

When creating a Template Letter, you have several options for formatting letters using the toolbar. 

<Info>
When adding formatting with the toolbar, you'll notice that it often adds extra symbols like `**` and `[]` to the page. Those symbols are part of Markdown, a way of defining document formatting with regular text. Template Letters fully support Markdown, and you can also add formatting just by typing those characters yourself if you prefer.

## Paragraphs and Line Breaks

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Creating Paragraphs">
  To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.
</Card>
<Card title="Creating Line Breaks">
  To create a line break or new line, end a line with two or more spaces and then type return.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

| Type this | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| This is a paragraph.<br><br>This is a second paragraph. | This is a paragraph.<br><br>This is a second paragraph. |
| This is the first line.  <br>And this is the second line. | This is the first line.<br>And this is the second line. |

## Text Emphasis

Use these Markdown symbols to emphasize text in your templates:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Bold Text" icon="bold">
  Add two asterisks `**` before and after text
</Card>
<Card title="Italic Text" icon="italic">
  Add one asterisk `*` before and after text
</Card>
<Card title="Bold and Italic" icon="text">
  Add three asterisks `***` before and after text
</Card>
<Card title="Strikethrough" icon="strikethrough">
  Add two tildes `~~` before and after text
</Card>
</CardGroup>

| Type this | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `I love **bold** text` | I love **bold** text |
| `I love *italic* text` | I love *italic* text |
| `I love ***bold and italic*** text` | I love ***bold and italic*** text |
| `I love ~~strikethrough~~ text` | I love ~~strikethrough~~ text |

## Headings

To create a title or heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The more number signs you use, the smaller the heading.

| Type this | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `# Big title` | # Big title |
| `## Medium title` | ## Medium title |
| `### Small title` | ### Small title |
| `#### Tiny title` | #### Tiny title |

## Quotes and Callouts

To add a quotation or call extra attention to a section of text, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

<Tip>
Quotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a `>` on the blank lines between the paragraphs.
</Tip>

| Type this | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `> This is a quote`<br>`> It can span multiple lines!` | > This is a quote<br>> It can span multiple lines! |

## Lists

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Numbered Lists">
  Add line items with numbers followed by periods.
</Card>
<Card title="Bullet Lists">
  Add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

| Type this | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `1. List item one`<br>`2. List item two`<br>`3. List item three` | 1. List item one<br>2. List item two<br>3. List item three |
| `- One thing`<br>`- Another thing`<br>`- And another thing` | • One thing<br>• Another thing<br>• And another thing |

## Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., `[Spare]`) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., `(https://sparelabs.com)`).

You can also add links without additional text by using angle brackets before and after the link URL.

| Type this | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `[Spare](https://sparelabs.com)` | [Spare](https://sparelabs.com) |
| `<https://sparelabs.com>` | <https://sparelabs.com> |

## Images

To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the URL of the image in parentheses.

<Warning>
The image must have a URL on the internet - it cannot be uploaded from your computer. If you need to post an image on the internet so you can link to it, we recommend using [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload).
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Standard Image">
  `![Alt text](https://example.com/image.png)`<br>
  Images automatically fill the full width of the page.
</Card>
<Card title="Custom Width Image">
  `<img src="https://example.com/image.png" style="width: 200px;">`<br>
  Use HTML with inline styles for custom sizing.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Dividers and Horizontal Rules

To create a divider, use three or more dashes (`---`), underscores (`___`), or asterisks (`***`) on a line by themselves.

<Note>
The visual appearance of all three options looks identical.
</Note>

## Letter Headers

You can use any combination of the formatting options above to create a header at the top of your letter.

<Tip>
For more control over things like image sizing, layout, font size, or font color, you can use [HTML with inline styles](https://www.codecademy.com/article/html-inline-styles).
</Tip>

Here are some premade headers you can paste into your letters. Just replace the text and URLs with your own content.
