## What are Variables?

Spare Eligibility allows you to create customized documents for any case by using Template Letters. 

If you add variables into your templates, the variables will be automatically filled in with real content whenever a letter is generated.

<Info>
Variables in Eligibility work similar to the variables in Rider Notifications that you might be familiar with in Spare Operations. Variables are always enclosed by triple curly brackets, like this: `{{{exampleVariable}}}`.
</Info>

### Key Differences from Notifications

<Card title="Custom Field Names">
  Variable names can come from the keys you've manually set on your own Form Fields and Custom Fields.
</Card>
<Card title="Multiple Data Sources">
  You can reference fields from multiple places within Spare, like rider profiles and case forms.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### How Variable Structure Works

You can access the contents of a field by writing the key of the object and the key of the field separated by a period.

<Tip>
You can find the key of a **Custom Field** or **Form Field** by clicking **Edit** and looking at the **Key field**.
</Tip>

#### Examples of Variable Structure

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="Rider Profile Fields">
To include the rider's first name in a Template Letter, you'll need to write the key of the rider object (`rider`) and the key of the field (`firstName`):

`{{{rider.firstName}}}`
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Custom Fields">
To include the value of a rider custom field, write the key of the rider object (`rider`) and the key of your custom field:

`{{{rider.yourCustomField}}}`
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Form Fields">
To use a field from an intake form (like "Name of your service animal"), include the key of the case's forms list (`forms`), then the specific form key (`intakeForm`), and then the field key:

`{{{forms.intakeForm.nameOfYourServiceAnimal}}}`
</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Commonly Used Variables

Here are some examples of commonly used variables:

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `{{{rider.firstName}}}` | The first name of the rider the case belongs to | Alex |
| `{{{rider.lastName}}}` | The last name of the rider the case belongs to | Caldwell |
| `{{{rider.phoneNumber}}}` | The phone number of the rider the case belongs to | 123-456-7890 |
| `{{{rider.email}}}` | The email address of the rider the case belongs to | alexcaldwell@sparelabs.com |
| `{{{date.current}}}` | The date the letter was generated on | June 15, 2023 |
| `{{{rider.yourCustomField}}}` | An example of a rider custom field. Replace "yourCustomField" with the key of the rider custom field you want to use | Depends on what the custom field is |
| `{{{forms.yourForm.yourFormField}}}` | An example of a form field. Replace "yourFormField" with the key of the form field you want to use, and replace "yourForm" with the key of the form that field belongs to | Depends on what the form field is |

<Warning>
Remember to replace placeholder text like `yourCustomField`, `yourForm`, and `yourFormField` with the actual keys from your Spare Eligibility setup.
</Warning>
