  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure Form Fields

Once in the form builder, you'll work with two types of fields:

<Accordion title="Field Types Overview">
  <AccordionItem title="Included (Default) Fields">
    These fields remain unchanged and are set up in the Field Manager. They're automatically added to all form templates to help identify riders.
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="Custom Fields">
    These fields can be added, edited, or removed from the form based on your specific needs.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

<Note>
The included rider profile fields help identify the rider and are added to all form templates by default. To modify these fields, navigate to **Organization Settings → Field Manager → Rider**.
