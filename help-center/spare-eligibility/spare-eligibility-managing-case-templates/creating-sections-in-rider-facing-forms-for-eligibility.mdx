## About This Feature

The ability to create sections in rider-facing forms is designed to streamline and enhance the user experience in Eligibility forms, such as paratransit eligibility applications. 

By breaking up lengthy forms, this feature helps riders more easily navigate and fill out forms in a more organized and accessible way.

## How It Works

Creating sections in the form layout involves setting up "content sections" that add breaks to the form. 

These breaks provide visual cues that allow riders to track their progress, making the form less overwhelming.

## Steps to Create Form Sections

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Form Template">
Navigate to the specific form template you want to edit in Eligibility. For instance, open a paratransit eligibility form template if you are working on eligibility applications.
</Step>

<Step title="Add a Content Section">
Within the Form Template, look for the option to add a new section. Select "Add Content Section" to insert a section break where you want to create separation in the form.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable the Break Option">
Set the "Create Break" option to **Yes** to activate the break in the form. This will create a visual division in the form for riders.
</Step>

<Step title="Preview and Test the Section Break">
Save your changes and open the rider-facing version of the form to see the section break in action. Each section break adds a visible line in the form template. This also introduces a **Progress Bar in the Rider Form** along with **Back** and **Continue** buttons, making it easier for riders to proceed through each part of the form.
</Step>
</Steps>

## What Section Breaks Add to Your Forms

When you create a section break, riders will see:

- **Horizontal line**: Visual separation between form sections
- **Progress bar**: Shows completion percentage through the form
- **Navigation buttons**: Back and Continue buttons for easy navigation
- **Improved flow**: Helps riders understand their position in the form
