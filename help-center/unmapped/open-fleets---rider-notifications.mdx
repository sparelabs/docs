title: "Open Fleets - Rider Notifications"

---

When a rider takes an Open Fleet trip booked through Spare, two sets of text notifications are typically set up: 

Notifications** from Spare** indicating that a **trip is booked** and a **vehicle arriving** notification.

Notifications **directly from the Open Fleet provider **(e.g., Lyft) with **driver information, vehicle information, and driver phone number**

## How does it work?Rider notifications through Spare should be set up for both **Processing** and **Accepted **states. This is because trips scheduled on Open Fleets, including Lyft, will be in a **Processing State **in 

Spare until **shortly** **before the requested pickup time of the trip**. 

To set up Rider Notifications from Spare, follow the instructions from the article below:

[Set Up Rider Notifications](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8984355-rider-notifications)

We recommend creating the following notifications with the "Push with fall back to SMS" option selected:

Scheduled pickup in ~24 hours (Processing requests)

Scheduled pickup ~1 hour (Processing requests)

Scheduled pickup ~1 hour (Accepted requests)

## Rider Notification ExamplesHere's an example of text for a** trip in the 

Processing status**:
â€‹

~24 hours before the trip pickup time:

Reminder that you have a ride **#{{rideInitialScheduledPickupTime}}** from **#{{rideScheduledPickupAddress}}** to **#{{rideScheduledDropoffAddress}} **with [Organization Name] Transit.

~1 hour before the trip pickup time:

You have a ride **#{{rideCurrentScheduledPickupTime}}** with [Organization Name] Transit. Please be ready 15 minutes before your pick as the exact timing can change. We will text again when the vehicle is 2 minutes away.
