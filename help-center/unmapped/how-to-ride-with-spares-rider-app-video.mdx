Check out the **Spare "How to Ride" video below** to learn how to use a Spare-powered rider app!

Otherwise, you can:

Download a service-branded rider application from Spare (check with the organization you're looking to ride with) or the Spare Rider app (it is free!) for[ iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spare-rider/id1414542240?ls=1) or [Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sparelabs.platform.rider.base&pli=1)and log in with your phone number.

On the home screen select “Get Started” to learn more about the service you're riding with. To get yourself set up, set your home and work addresses as favorite locations for quick trip access.

Back on the home screen select “Where are you going?”, then select your origin and destination. If you have not entered your payment information in the Payments section of your Account, you will have to enter payment information before being able to book a trip (where pre-payment is required).
