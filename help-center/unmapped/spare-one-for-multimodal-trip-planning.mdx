**Spare One** brings fixed-route and on-demand services together into a single, seamless platform. For riders and booking agents, it means simpler trip planning. For agencies, it means less operational complexity—and more control.

This guide walks you through three core capabilities of Spare One, with short video demos to help you get started.

## Multimodal trip planning for Riders Riders just enter a destination—the app automatically plans a complete trip that may include walking, buses, trains, or on-demand vehicles. Each journey is presented as a single, connected experience with real-time tracking, transfer guidance, and accurate arrival times. No need to switch apps or piece together or pay for different legs—Spare 

One handles it all.
