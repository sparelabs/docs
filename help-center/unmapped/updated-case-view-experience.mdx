At Spare, we consistently want to make the Case Management experience in Engage easier one step at a time. With these updates we want to enable easy access to all the different parts linked to the Case including Forms, Letters, Group Memberships and Activity Log.

The objective of this update is to reduce scrolling and the number of tabs and windows you need to keep open.
