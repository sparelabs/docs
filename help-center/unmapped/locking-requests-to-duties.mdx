What is the "Lock to Duty," and why should I use it?

How do I use the feature on the Spare Platform and lock a request to a duty?

How do I unlock the request or re-assign it to another driver?

Can I lock multiple requests to the same duty?

# **What is Lock to Duty?**Lock to Duty is a feature that allows dispatchers to manually lock a request to a specific duty and ensure the Spare system doesn‚Äôt move it.

# **How does it work?**Once you apply the Lock to Duty to a specific request, the system will lock the trip in place, assigned to a specific driver, but will keep the rest of the driver's manifest open to optimization.

If the trip doesn't fit with the current requests on the vehicle, Spare will automatically rematch other requests on the vehicle as long as those requests still fit their stated trip flexibilities.

# **What is the value?** Spare Engine constantly optimizes drivers' duties to increase efficiency.

But sometimes you know something about the real world that Spare Engine doesn't. There may be unplanned situations, special rider requests, or specific local knowledge that requires dispatchers to use manual options to improve the daily schedule. Lock to Duty allows you to address such situations and make sure the customer's needs are met.

If the Lock to Duty feature is enabled by your Administrator, you can access and edit it via Requests.

Lock to Duty is applicable to: ‚úîÔ∏è New requests; ‚úîÔ∏è Existing requests;

# How to (Manually) Assign a Request to a DutyWatch the video below to see how to do this 

From your Spare Operations account, go to the Rides tab, switch to Requests, and create/edit a Request you'd like to lock.

From the Request Edit page, scroll down to Duty and mark the "Lock this request to a duty" checkbox to see what duties are available. 

*Any scheduled or in-progress duties with the relevant capabilities, fleet connections, and within a few hours of the request will be available to select.*

Select the duty and leave a comment in the designated box to let others in your organization know why you are assigning the request to that specific duty.

Once you‚Äôve selected a duty, you‚Äôll see an updated estimate for the current request and preview what other requests will be affected by this change.

Lock to Duty is **now** available in the Overrides Flexibilities modal and unified with all other overrides functionality üôå

All overrides functionalities have been consolidated into a unified overrides modal - Force Match, Lock to Duty, Extend Duty, and Override Requests. This modal provides a clear last resort to ensure a request can be matched with a duty.

# How to (Manually) Re-Assign the Request to Another DutyWatch the video below to see how to do this

If you need to edit the request you already locked, go to the Rides tab, switch to Requests, and open the Request Edit page.

In the Request Edit page, scroll down to the "Lock this request to a duty" checkbox and choose a different duty from the dropdown. This will continue to exclude the request from any optimization Spare is doing.

# FAQ**What happens if the duty I‚Äôve locked the request to is canceled?**

- The request will be automatically unlocked and rematched to another duty like all the other requests on the canceled duty.

**Can I still change the details of a locked request?**

- Yes. However, if the duty the request is locked to can‚Äôt accommodate the new request details (e.g., the updated number of passengers or accessibility features), the system will not be able to give you an estimate. You will need to lock the request to a new duty or remove the lock to get an estimate.

**Can I lock multiple requests to the same duty?**

- Yes. If there are trips you want to be pooled together, either for accessibility or efficiency reasons, then you can lock multiple requests to the same duty to ensure they will be pooled.
