| Track the status of their submitted eligibility applications. | Continue working on applications they haven't finished. |

Start new eligibility applications.

**New Form submission Experience:** Introduces an updated interface for filling out forms, featuring:

| Modern user experience design. | Improved form validation. |

| Enhanced accessibility. | Automatic saving of progress, allowing riders to resume later. |

## Setting up the Rider HubFollow these steps to make your eligibility applications accessible through the Rider 

| Hub: | ![Rider Hub Setup Interface in Spare Admin](/images/spare-eligibility/additional-features/rider-hub-setup-interface.png)**Accessing Your Rider Hub Link:** |

- Navigate to **Rider Interfaces** in Spare Admin. You will find a new section for **Rider Hub**, displaying a direct link and a QR code. This is the main entry point for your riders.

2. **Configuring Case Templates for Rider Hub:**

- Navigate to the **Case Template** section in Spare Admin and select the specific eligibility application template you want to make available in the Rider Hub (e.g., "Paratransit Eligibility Application").

Click **Edit** on the case template and **Enable External Visibility:**This allows riders to see and start this application type from the Rider Hub.

**Set External Facing Name:** Define an **External facing name** for the template. This is the user-friendly name riders will see in the Rider Hub (e.g., "Apply for Paratransit Service"). This can differ from the internal name used by staff.

**Assign a Default Form:** Ensure a **Default Form** is associated with the case template. This is the specific form riders will fill out when they start a new application of this type via the Rider Hub.

**Save** the changes to the case template.

**3. Configuring Status Names for Riders:**

- Within the same Case Template editor, navigate to the **Status** section.For each status you want riders to see, you can define how it appears externally.

Edit a specific status (e.g., "Application Submitted", "Under Review", "Approved").You will see fields for:

**Internal Name:** The name used within the Spare platform (visible to staff).

**External Name:** The name displayed to riders in the Rider Hub. This allows you to present simplified or more rider-friendly status descriptions (e.g., Internal: "Pending Docs" -> External: "Action Required - Documents Needed").

| Set the appropriate **External Name** for each relevant status and **Save** the changes. | ## The Form Submission Experience |

| Once configured: | Riders can access the Rider Hub using the link or QR code provided in Spare Admin (which you can share on your website or other communication channels). |

| After logging in, they will see options based on the Case Templates you have made externally visible. | They can: |

**Start New Applications:** Click on an available application type to begin filling out the associated form.

**Continue Applications:** If they previously started but didn't finish a form, they can resume from where they left off. Progress is automatically saved.

**Track Applications:** View the status of their submitted applications (using the "External Names" you configured).

## Important Considerations: Updating LinksIf your organization has previously embedded direct links to specific eligibility application forms on your public website, in emails, or other rider communications, **these old links will need to be replaced by the new link. Your Spare 

| Representative can assist with this transition.** | - There are two main options: |

**Link to the Rider Hub:** Update your website to point riders to the main Rider Hub URL (found under Rider Interfaces in Spare Admin). This gives riders the full experience of tracking, continuing, and starting applications.

**Link Directly to the New Application Form:** If you prefer to link directly to start a specific application, you can do so by obtaining the link to individual Cases.
