Please speak to your Spare Representative if you wish to enable Fleet Area Restrictions

Fleet Area Restrictions allow agencies to assign specific operating zones to each fleet. This ensures vehicles only serve trips where both the pickup and drop-off are within the designated area. It’s especially helpful for agencies that want to commingle their microtransit and paratransit services, but also want their microtransit vehicles to stay in their intended zones. 

## How does it work?With Fleet Area Restrictions, you can define where each fleet is allowed to operate. Trips will only be assigned to a fleet if both the pickup and drop-off locations fall inside the designated zone. 

This helps maintain service integrity and prevents vehicles from being routed far outside their intended areas.

**Important:****Fleet Area Restrictions are designed to manage service areas, not** to optimize fleet productivity or reduce deadhead mileage. Using this feature to force efficiency gains can actually **decrease On-Time Performance (OTP)** and **Passengers Per Vehicle Hour (PPVH)**. Always use this feature to control service zones, not as a tool for operational efficiency.

## Accessing the Fleet Area SettingsFrom the Spare Operations Dashboard, go to **Service 

Planning** in the left-hand menu.

Click **Fleets**.

Select the fleet you want to configure by clicking its name.

On the Fleet Details page, click **Edit Fleet** in the top right corner.

## Editing the Fleet AreaIn the edit screen, adjust the **Fleet 

Area** by drawing or modifying the zone restrictions directly on the map.

Ensure the boundary reflects where this fleet should operate.

Click **Save** to apply changes.

Once saved, this fleet will only be assigned trips that begin and end within the defined zone.

## FAQ**Can I use Fleet Area 

Restrictions to improve fleet efficiency or reduce deadhead?**
No. This feature is not intended for optimizing productivity. Using it this way can reduce key performance metrics like On-Time Performance. It’s best used strictly for defining service areas.

**What if my depot or driver’s starting location is outside the fleet area?**
That’s totally fine. The fleet area only applies to trip assignments. Vehicles can start or end their duties outside the zone without any issues.

**What happens if a trip’s pickup or drop-off is outside the zone?**
The trip won’t be matched to that fleet. Both points must be within the fleet’s zone for assignment.

**Can I create multiple separate zones for one fleet?**
No, each fleet can only have one continuous zone. For separate areas, create additional fleets.

**Will changing the fleet area impact trips already scheduled?**
No, updates to the zone only apply to future trip matching after saving changes.
