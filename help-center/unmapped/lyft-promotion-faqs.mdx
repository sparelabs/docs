To celebrate Spare’s partnership with Lyft, Spare is providing **100 free trips**, **$100 trip cost or less, **to our valued customers across** the United States!**

- The promotion will be valid until Spare communicates a specific program end date. Spare will provide at least two weeks' notice prior to ending the promotion.

## How does the promotion work?You will see the **promotion notice **on the **Spare Platform**. Once you **accept the promotion **(note that only **admins** can do it), Spare will **automatically create a Lyft service** in your organization - however, this service will not be viewable to you under your 

Services page. 

The Lyft service will allow you or your reservationists to book trips to Lyft **anywhere in the United States** where Lyft is available, not just in your specified service area, as long as the trip costs **less than $100**.

## Lyft Open Fleets Key FactsThe system will only allow you to book a **maximum of 3 riders** on a 

Lyft trip.

The Lyft service will not be able to accommodate any** accessibility devices** (e.g., wheelchairs).

The Lyft service will not be a pooled service, and it will consist of **individual trips only.**

- Lyft limits **driver trip notes to 100 characters,** so only the first 100 characters of a trip’s notes will be shown to the Lyft driver.

A rider’s **default request preferences may not fully populate **on the Lyft service, given some of its constraints around rider types, accessibility devices, and trip notes.

Every Lyft trip **during the promotion period **will show **$0 **in Spare Platform because that’s what you and your rider will be paying for the trip - nothing!

## Top Tips for Booking Fantastic Lyft Trips!**Communication to riders is always key! **Make sure that riders know to look out for a Lyft vehicle and driver. Riders will get a text message sent to the primary phone number on their 

Spare profile with the driver’s phone number in case they need to get in contact with them.

Use the **100 character maximum **in the trip notes we send to Lyft and **add as much detail on the pickup location** as possible (i.e., the business/building name, description, building and/or unit number).

When booking a trip to/from a business location, always **search by the business name** rather than the physical address (e.g., “Walmart” instead of “100 Main Street”) on trip requests. This way, the business name shows to the Lyft driver!

Encourage the rider to **open the Lyft app from the Spare Rider app** and/or the Lyft notifications. When opening the Lyft app, the rider’s location will be sent to the Lyft Driver App so that the Lyft driver can more easily locate the rider.

## FAQs **Why isn’t it letting me book a trip to the 

Lyft service?**

- In some cases, the system will fail to retrieve an estimate for the Lyft service due to one of the following reasons:

If a rider’s profile does not have a primary phone number on file, the trip will fail to retrieve an estimate because Lyft requires a rider's phone number to create a booking. If this is the case, you will see the “Unable to find trip…” error code.

If the trip you searched for is over $100, the trip will fail to retrieve an estimate, and you will see the “Unable to find trip…” error code.

**What trip types will riders be able to book?**

- You are able to book either an on-demand “Leave as soon as possible” or scheduled “Leave at” trip to the Lyft promotion service.

For on-demand **“Leave as soon as possible” **trips, the trip will be automatically dispatched to the Lyft driver network.

For scheduled **“Leave at” **trips, the trip will enter the **Processing** state and then will be offered to the Lyft driver network 10 minutes before the requested pickup time.

**What will riders experience?**

- After a trip has been booked, riders will receive an SMS text message with Lyft’s [Terms & Conditions](https://www.lyft.com/terms). Riders will continue to receive Spare Platform notifications as they would normally as well. Riders will not have to pay any fare for their trip!

Please note that Lyft is a curb-to-curb service. Lyft drivers will have the ability to call the rider once they arrive at the pickup location. We ask that you let riders know that they should be looking out for their Lyft vehicle.

**Why can’t I see the Lyft Promotion service under my Services?**

- The Lyft Promotion service is hidden to protect its configuration parameters. However, you can still see the Lyft fleet and Lyft vehicles on the live map when they are taking one of your trips. 

You can also see the Lyft Time Rules - although we advise against modifying these. Finally, you will be able to see the Lyft trips in your platform KPIs and reports in **Spare **Analytics.

**Will I be charged any additional fees?**

- No, Spare will cover the entire cost of the Lyft trips for the duration of the promotion. You will not be billed any fees for your participation!

**How do I turn the promotion off?**

- If you’d like to turn the promotion off once accepting it, or you just want the promotion notice disabled, please contact your Spare Success Manager. The Spare Team will be able to disable the Lyft promotion service and/or notice within 24 hours of receiving your request.

**How does the Lyft promotion abide by FTA rules and regulations?**

- In order to comply with Controlled Substance and Alcohol Testing Requirements [outlined by the FTA](https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/shared-mobility-faqs-controlled-substance-and-alcohol-testing-requirements), you must provide riders with the option to take an FTA-compliant trip. Please be aware that it is your responsibility to ensure compliance with Federal Transit Administration requirements.
