## What is this feature?

If an agency wants to keep their ridership gated (think paratransit eligibility), it becomes difficult to offer a rider app where just anybody can sign up.

Prior to this feature, any rider could log into the organization’s rider app but then would be unable to book. This is annoying for the rider (who feels as though the app doesn’t work) and annoying for the agency who now has a bunch of empty profiles of riders who aren’t eligible.

## How does it work?First, head to "

## FAQ**

Does this change affect all or some riders?**

- Keep in mind that this feature is organization-wide and so it will effect all riders, not just certain groups.

**How does this work for organizations using Eligibility?**

- This feature has no effect on Eligibility applications. Riders can still submit a form without a registered account.
