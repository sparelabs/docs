The current login process for riders to submit a Case requires them to login with a phone number. We understand that not all riders have phone numbers, and in cases where phone numbers are shared among multiple riders in the same household, it is a blocker to submit cases for riders sharing phone numbers. Allowing riders to Login with an Email is step to forward to ensure more Cases can be submitted using a digital medium.

Riders can submit Cases online only if you have Spare's Form URL setup on your website or you have shared the link to submit a Case with an individual rider.
