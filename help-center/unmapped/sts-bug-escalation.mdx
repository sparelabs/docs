title: "STS Bug Escalation"
description: ""
---

This process is designed to improve the speed and clarity of bug reporting between STS and Spare's development team. This process is new, and feedback is encouraged.

## **Reporting a New Bug****1. Report issue**: Report any new bugs by emailing `support+sts@spare.com`. 

For efficiency, please use the template below:

**Frequency:** *(how often does a user encounter the bug? Does it only occur at certain times)*

**Workaround:** *(is there a way to bypass the bug?)*

**Observed Behaviour:** *(tell us what you’re seeing, ideally in “when this, then that” language or a screen recordings)*

**Expected Behaviour:** *(tell us what should happen, so we know what a solution should do)*

**How to reproduce:** *(steps for recreating the observed behaviour)*

**Details & Links:** *(please link the relevant intercom or Slack conversation and tell us anything else we should know)*

**2. Initial Review**:

Spare's support team will perform an initial scoping of the issue and confirm the bug can be reproduced.

If the bug has been previously reported:

The new ticket will be linked to the existing issue.

You will be informed of the status and progress of the existing issue.

For new bugs:

The issue will be scored and escalated to the appropriate development team.

**3. Prioritization and Assignment**:

For high priority bugs, the development team will work on the bug in the next sprint. 

For low priority bugs, the timeline for addressing the bug will be balanced against ongoing feature development work.

## Additional Details**How can I track the progress of a bug 

I reported?**
We're working on an effective way to view all of the bugs that have been logged with each of the different development teams. 

**What happens if a bug cannot be reproduced?**
If our team cannot reproduce the bug, you may be contacted for additional details. Providing detailed information upfront can help avoid delays.

**What does the priority level mean?**

- Our development teams prioritize bugs based on the following:

**Priority**

**Impact**

**P1: Urgent**

• Users **cannot** complete essential tasks (eg: creating new trips)**• Damaging to revenue and reputation. Every hour** that this goes unfixed increases the likelihood of us missing our goals

**P2: High**

• Users experience difficulty completing **essential** tasks**• Damaging to revenue and reputation. Every day** that this goes unfixed increases the likelihood of us missing our goals

**P3: Medium**

• Users experience difficulty completing tasks
• Damaging to reputation, but unlikely to impact revenue. Every week that this goes unfixed increases the likelihood of us missing our goals.

**P4: Low**

• Users experience friction completing tasks
• Unlikely to impact our goals

**P5: Lowest**

• Users won’t notice this bug
