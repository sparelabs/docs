## About this featureRecurring Group Trips help agencies efficiently pool riders who travel together on a consistent schedule—like to adult day programs, dialysis appointments, or training centers. 

This feature is especially useful for operations managers and schedulers looking to boost ride grouping for predictable, repeated trips while reducing manual route planning.

## How does it work?Recurring Group Trips lets you select repeat rides that share common times or locations so the engine can intelligently group them. You can even assign a preferred driver. This feature is powered by 

Spare’s dynamic scheduling engine and aims to improve passenger grouping and vehicle utilization, while keeping the scheduling hands-off.

## Step 1: Navigate to Recurring Trip GroupsUnder 'Recurring Trips', select the 'Recurring Trip Groups'

## Step 2: Add A Recurring Trip Group

Give the group a name, and optionally add a description.

## Step 3: (Optional) Assign a preferred driverYou can specify a driver to help create consistency and routine for both the driver and the passengers. 

This is especially valuable when serving adult day programs or medical centers where routine builds trust and comfort.

If the assigned driver is available, the engine will prioritize grouping these riders on their vehicle.

If the driver isn’t available due to schedule conflicts, time off, or vehicle constraints, the engine will still try to group the trips without them.

## Step 4: Add eligible recurring trips

To group riders effectively, their trips must meet one of these conditions:

**Same pickup location and pickup time**, or

**Same drop-off location and drop-off time**

- When adding recurring trips to a group, the location must match **exactly** - down to every character. Even minor variations will prevent successful grouping:

"USA" vs. "US"

"Street" vs. "St."

"Avenue" vs. "Ave"

If locations appear identical but trips still can't be grouped, create a standardized stop in the service and update all recurring trips to use this stop instead.

Follow these steps to create a new Recurring Group Trip:

**Select the direction** of the trips you want to group: either pickup or drop-off.

**Search for a rider** whose recurring trip fits your grouping criteria.

**Choose a recurring trip** from their profile.

If the trip cannot be grouped with those already selected (due to mismatched times or locations), you’ll see an error message.

Repeat the search and selection steps to add more riders to the group.

When you're ready, click **"Create New Recurring Group Trip"** to finalize.

## Step 5: Let the engine handle the pooling

Spare’s engine will now try to pool the selected trips based on your inputs:

It will **prioritize grouping these trips**, even if it needs to **bend detour flexibility limits or OTP (On-Time Performance) windows** to do it.

If **grouping is not possible** due to vehicle capacity, accessibility needs, or driver availability, the engine will fall back and schedule them as individual trips.

⚠️ Important: Because the engine prioritizes grouping over strict timing, this feature may have a slight negative impact on your On-Time Performance. 

## FAQ**

- What happens if one of the riders in the group cancels or changes their trip?**
The system will automatically adjust grouping logic. It will still group the remaining riders. 

**Does this feature guarantee the same driver every time?**
No. While you can assign a preferred driver, the system only honors this if the driver is available and doesn't violate the driver restrictions of riders in the group. It's a strong preference, not a hard rule.

**Does this feature guarantee the riders are pooled together every time?**
No. The system only honors this if there's a vehicle available that can accommodate all the riders, their accessibility features, vehicle type restrictions, driver restrictions and rider-to-rider restrictions.
