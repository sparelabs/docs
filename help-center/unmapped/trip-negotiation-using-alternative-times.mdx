At Spare, we understand that service reliability and performance is paramount for Paratransit services. 

**Trip Negotiation with Alternative Times** is a feature designed to improve the likelihood of on-time pickups for your riders while balancing peak service hours. This tool empowers reservationists to find the most suitable and reliable trip times, when the rider's initially requested isn't available or is predicted to be late.
â€‹

## How Trip Negotiation with Alternative Times Works***For Scheduling Leave At requests:** 

Spare will display available time slots both before* and *after* the initially requested time.

**For "Arrive By" requests:** To ensure the rider reaches their destination on time, Spare will only show *earlier* available time slots.

These alternative time windows are configurable to meet the specific needs and policies of your service.

A)

As shown in the image, the windows now includes color-coded badges:

ðŸŸ© **On Time (Green):** There is a high probability that a vehicle will arrive within the promised window for this trip.

ðŸŸ§ **Possibly Late (Orange):**There is a moderate chance of a delay for this trip based on current scheduling for that time.

ðŸŸ¥ **Likely Late (Red):** No Drivers Available. There is a high probability that this trip will be delayed and can only be booked as an unmatched trip.

This system allows reservationists to immediately identify the most reliable trip options and provide the rider a time that is more likely to result in a positive experience. It's recommended to offer the estimates with On Time badge first.

## ## How does Alternative Booking Options Impact the Rider App?In the rider app, you don't choose between different trip times yourself. 

Instead, if the time you want isn't available, the app will automatically pick and show you the next best time. 

## ## How to configure this?In service settings you can configure the number of alternative on-time performance windows Spare will search through in order to display these options. 

These settings can be configured to modify the earliest and latest alternative times displayed to booking agents.

## FAQs

Will all the windows always be shown?

No, the additional time windows are only shown when the originally requested time doesn't provide an On Time estimate.

**Is there access to reporting on the impact this is having on the service?**

- Analytics for this are not directly available in the platform but you can request your Spare Representative for a custom report.

**What determines if a trip is classified as "Possibly Late" or "Likely Late"?**

- The classification is determined by Spare's AI Engine, which analyzes vehicle availability, existing trip manifests, vehicle capacity, and predicted travel times. If booking a trip would cause lateness, the trip may be flagged as "Possibly Late" or "Likely Late."
â€‹

**Can we customize the time windows for the alternative suggestions?**

- Yes. The time windows that Spare searches before and after a requested "Leave At" time (or before an "Arrive By" time) are configurable to align with your agency's policies.
