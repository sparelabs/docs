The Live Map is a great place to get a visual representation of your entire on-demand operations. 

The dark blue area represents your service zone boundary, and the vehicles represent the drivers you currently have on duty.

# What are the statuses of my vehicles?

The color of the vehicles on the map will change to indicate their status:

- **Green**: 0-2 minutes offline or 0-30 seconds late
- **Yellow**: 30 seconds to 10 minutes late
- **Red**: 10+ minutes late
- **Black**: 2+ minutes offline
- **White**: Driver on a break
- **Grey**: Paused vehicle
- **Blue**: Idle vehicle (no upcoming trips at all, but available)

Hovering over or clicking on a vehicle will give you more information on the status and trip manifest of that duty.

> **Note:** The vehicle will still show as Green if all of the next four trips are on time.
>
> If a vehicle has an 8 hour shift with 10 trips and the fifth trip is anticipated to be 3 minutes late, the vehicle will _still show as Green_. The Spare Engine has opportunities to fix that lateness, and so the vehicle on the Live Map will remain green.

> **Note:** The vehicle will start to show as Red and Yellow if one of the next four trips is running late. Here's an example: 

Driver A has the following manifest:

1. Pickup Joe
2. Dropoff Joe
3. Pickup Susie
4. **Pickup Craig**
5. Dropoff Susie
6. Pickup Jane
7. Dropoff Jane
8. **Dropoff Craig**
9. Pickup Dan
10. Dropoff Dan

If Craig's dropoff is running 3 minutes late, the vehicle will show as Yellow.

# How can I view more details on a specific vehicle?

By selecting a specific vehicle, a Vehicle Details panel will show the vehicle's current status, including:

- Vehicle Location Last Updated
- Vehicle (click to see details)
- Duty (click to see details)
- Driver (click to see details)
- Upcoming Requests with upcoming pickups and dropoffs

The live map also includes further details on which pickups or dropoffs are currently on time or running behind, which is indicated by the yellow/red vehicle.

> **Note:** A vehicle is considered to be late if its estimated arrival time is outside of the pickup/dropoff window.
