## Driver & Dispatcher Workflows

**If drivers are allowed to cancel requests**:

They will see a "Cancel Request" option in the driver app. Upon selecting it, they can specify the cancellation reason and the request will be cancelled.

**If cancellations must be dispatcher-approved**:

Drivers will see a "Request Cancellation" option in the driver app. Upon selecting it, it sends a message to dispatchers requesting the cancellation.

Cancellation requests from drivers appear in the dispatcher dashboard under "Messages".

Dispatchers can review the request details and decide to approve or reject based on service policies.

## FAQ

### Why might an agency restrict drivers from canceling trips independently?

Agencies may prefer dispatchers to oversee cancellations to ensure all required steps—such as waiting and contacting riders—are properly completed, minimizing rider dissatisfaction and missed service commitments.

### How are drivers informed about the cancellation process?

Drivers receive in-app prompts detailing the required steps for cancellations. 

Training materials can also be provided by the agency to ensure compliance.

### Can the policy be customized for different driver groups?

Yes, agencies can define cancellation policies per service, allowing flexibility based on service type or operational requirements.
