# Overview

The Duty Schedule Breakdown provides a comprehensive look at the upcoming schedules for drivers, detailing how the **Spare Engine** predicts time will be spent. It covers various aspects of a driver's day, from trips planned to the specifics of each duty period.

## Understanding the Duty Schedule

Upon viewing the duty schedule for upcoming duties, the interface will display a breakdown of predicted activities. 

This includes both the trips in the driver's itinerary and the allocation of time to different types of tasks.

## Colour Coding Scheme

The interface uses a colour-coded system to easily distinguish between types of activities:

**Blue**: Idle - Periods where the driver is not actively being directed to perform tasks.

**Gray**: On break - Times when the driver is taking a scheduled break.

**Light Gray**: Transporting passengers - The driver is en route to a destination with passengers.

**Pink**: Deadheading - The driver is heading to a destination but without any passengers on board.

**Green**: Boarding - Time spent loading or unloading passengers from the vehicle.

## Real-Time Updates

Once the duty begins, the section labeled "Duty Time Travel" will update in real-time to reflect the ongoing activities, replacing the initial predictive schedule.

## Current Limitations

This feature is currently available only for viewing upcoming duties. 

The real-time activity tracking starts as the duty commences.
