We are sorry to hear you are having vehicle troubles! This is always stressful, and we're here to help you! Spare's **Vehicle Breakdown Tool **is taught to deal with such situations, **seamlessly assisting **you in the background without much manual work from your side.

## What is the Vehicle Breakdown Tool?This tool helps dispatchers when a vehicle is unable to continue its duty due to an unexpected event like a breakdown, and ensures every passenger on the manifest, including passengers onboard the vehicle make it to their destination. 

Here’s what happens:

**Passengers on the vehicle: **Any in-progress trips are automatically re-created with a **pickup at the location where the vehicle broke down**. Spare's Engine then automatically tries to match these trips with another duty. If there is space, the trips status will transition to **Accepted**. If there is no space, they’ll become **[Unmatched](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8994566-unmatched-requests)**.

**Pickups in the future:** Spare's Engine automatically attempts** to match these trips with another duty**. If there is space, the trips status will transition to **Accepted**. If there is no space, they’ll become **[Unmatched](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8994566-unmatched-requests).**

## How does it work?It all starts when you **cancel a duty**. For that, you should go to Spare Operations, select the Shift 

Scheduling tab, locate the duty you need to cancel, and click on its card.

Once you click “Cancel,” a **popup appears,** letting you know that Spare will rematch requests to other duties, and that riders onboard the vehicle will have their pickup location changed to the vehicle's current location.

**The Spare's Engine will then automatically attempt** to find homes for these trips on other duties.

If there is nowhere for these trips to go, they’ll become** [Unmatched](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8994566-unmatched-requests)**,** **which can be found in **Mission Control**, then **Live Requests**.

If you have a replacement vehicle available,[ create a new duty](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8967719-managing-duties#h_ea17abaa14). Spare's Engine will automatically assign unmatched trips from the broken-down vehicle to this new duty. 

If a passenger is on a vehicle when it is cancelled, we create a new pick-up for the passenger at the vehicle's current location. A side-effect of this is that the on-time performance information for the pick-up of the request and the Originally requested pickup time is overwritten.
