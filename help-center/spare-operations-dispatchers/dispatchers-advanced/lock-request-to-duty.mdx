## What is Lock to Duty?Lock to Duty is a feature that allows dispatchers to **manually lock a request **to a specific duty and ensure the **

- Spare system doesn‚Äôt move it.**

## How does it work?Once you apply the Lock to 

Duty to a specific request, the system will lock the trip in place, assigned to a specific driver, but will keep the rest of the driver's manifest open to optimization.

## What is the value?Spare Engine constantly optimized drivers' duties to increase efficiency. But sometimes you know something about the real world that Spare Engine doesn't. There may be **unplanned situations, special rider requests or specific local knowledge** that requires dispatchers to manually improve the schedule. Lock to 

Duty allows you to address these situations and make sure customer's needs are met. 

Lock to Duty is applicable to:

‚úîÔ∏è New requests;

‚úîÔ∏è Existing requests;

# **How to Manually Assign (Lock) a Request During Creation:****1Ô∏è‚É£** In **Spare Operations**, go to the **Rides **tab, switch to **Requests,** and create/edit a **Request** you'd like to **lock**.

**3Ô∏è‚É£** **Select the duty **and **leave a comment** in the designated box to let others in your organization know why you are assigning the request to that specific duty.

# **FAQs****‚û°Ô∏è What happens if the duty I‚Äôve locked the request to is cancelled?**

- The request will be automatically unlocked and rematched to another duty like all the other requests on the cancelled duty.

**‚û°Ô∏è Can I still change the details of a locked request?**

- Yes. However, if the duty the request is locked to can‚Äôt accommodate the new request details (e.g., the updated number of passengers or accessibility features), the system will not be able to give you an estimate. You will need to lock the request to a new duty or remove the lock to get an estimate.

**‚û°Ô∏è Can I lock multiple requests to the same duty?**

- Yes. If there are trips you want to be pooled together, either for accessibility or efficiency reasons, then you can lock multiple requests to the same duty to ensure they will be pooled.
