Dispatch Backup Files provide the dispatch team with a redundancy for situations where Spare may be unavailable. 

Dispatchers can access backups at any time to ensure service continuity and support both drivers and riders effectively.

## How Does It Work?

Review the video or follow the steps below to access the backup manifest.

## Accessing the Backup File

**Open the Access Email**: 

An authorized access email is sent every 12 hours to the recovery email configured by your administrators, but backups will update more frequently. Even if the email was sent several hours ago, the link will always fetch the most recent backup. Eg: an email sent 8 hours ago can access the backup from 15 minutes ago.

**Download the Backup**:

Click the link in the email to download the latest version of the backup.

The most recent backup will be downloaded as a password protected zip file.

**Open the File**:

Unzipping the file will require the Admin Backup Code configured by your team.

Open the downloaded xlsx file in a spreadsheet application to view information about any upcoming or in progress trips.

## Backup File Tabs

**Request Data**: The first tab includes all upcoming trips and their statuses. 

Fare costs are displayed in cents for precision.

**Driver-Specific Tabs**: Details about a driverâ€™s current and upcoming stops, including pickups and dropoffs.
