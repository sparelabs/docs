There are several ways you can investigate a driver's activity:

By analyzing their duty history and itinerary;

By locating the driver on the Live Map;

By viewing their location using the Time Travel feature;

## Viewing Duty 

History

From the Driver Information page, click on a duty record to jump into the **Duty Information page**. 

![Spare Platform Screenshot. Exploring duty history form the driver profile page.](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/967280748/96a61c80eb863fea1e5b8c6e/gmWtOGiKJC7eYZXPAqd_-mhdSgaSBmL6qQ.png?expires=1753820100&signature=0062c45388c41492521337f34506e53f1b0a825522ed456d702841b4f87e5643&req=fSYgFMF%2BmoVXFb4f3HP0gOv6QQW%2FWkyv754JYKJdXIwrmQzBylo7cinqqCNI%0Akkg%3D%0A)

From there, you will see the duty general information, its Time Travel map, duty itinerary, and the activity log (all changes happened to the duty)

You can now use the **"Download Vehicle Speeds and Locations"** feature to export location details and speeds in CSV or Excel format. 
​
To calculate speeds, we take the location points we receive from the driver tablet and then remove any points received when the vehicle is stationary. We then calculate the speed required to travel from the previous point to that one.
