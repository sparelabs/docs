# What is Pause Duty?Sometimes, a dispatcher doesn’t want things to change on a driver’s schedule. Pause Duty is the solution. **When a duty is paused, it will not undergo optimization, and no new requests will be automatically matched to it.**

- By utilizing Pause Duty, dispatchers can temporarily halt the matching of new requests to a duty and prevent the duty from being optimized by Live Duty Optimization and Global Optimization.

Exceptions exist where requests can still be matched to a duty if a dispatcher manually makes this decision. There are two ways a dispatcher could match a trip to a paused duty:

[Force Match](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8967377-moving-a-trip-request-to-a-new-duty)

[Lock to Duty](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8967377-moving-a-trip-request-to-a-new-duty#h_ab99a049c5)

This improved functionality of Pause Duty ensures that dispatchers can more effectively manage their fleets, respond to real-time challenges, and maintain service reliability and efficiency.

# **How do I manually pause optimization?**You can easily do so either from the Live Map or from the Duty page:

## **Live Map**Go to the Live Map and locate the vehicle you'd like to make changes to (use the search bar to make it faster). Click on the vehicle icon and select **

- Pause**.

## **Duty Page**Go to the scheduling tab and select duties. Locate the duty you'd like to make changes to. Open the duty information page and click **

- Pause**.

You will then see **four options**:

**Pause**: To continue normal operation, click Resume. 

**Pause for 10 min**: When time is up, the duty will resume automatically and return to normal operation.

**Pause for 30 min**: When time is up, the duty will resume automatically and return to normal operation.

**Choose Pause Length (see below):** Set how long the duty should remain paused for. When time is up, the duty will resume automatically and return to normal operation.

**I**n all cases when the duty has been paused, Spare won’t perform any optimization on this duty and no new requests will be automatically matched to it. The order of the duty schedule won’t be changed, but requests can still be manually matched to the duty by using Lock to Duty or Force Match.

# # FAQ#### Is there a maximum time that you can set the pause timer for?Nope! However, the duty can still end, which effectively ends the pause. 

So it’s not unlimited.
