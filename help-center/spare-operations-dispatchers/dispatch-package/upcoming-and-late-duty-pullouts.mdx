There's a lot that can happen at the beginning of a driver's duty, even more so if you have multiple pullouts happening at once. Staying on top of late pullouts is critical to ensuring the beginning of each shift goes smoothly.

## How can I see where duties will be pulling out?

On the Live Map, select **

Pullouts** and today's duty start locations will be displayed on the map.

## How can I see upcoming and late pullouts?

Dispatchers have the ability to track late and upcoming pullouts in the Live Map, and can spot potential lateness right as it happens. 

Boost on-time performance while maintaining efficiency. 

On the Live Map, select **List Duties** and view all duties:  

- **Late Pullouts**: Based on shift start time and when the driver logs into their device to start duty
- **Pullouts in the Next Hour**: Shows time until start
- **In Progress**: Shows the driver's status (Lateness, On Time, Idle, No Connection)
