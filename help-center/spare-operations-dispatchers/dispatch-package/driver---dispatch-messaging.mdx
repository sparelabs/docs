## What is Driver - Dispatch Messaging?

This feature enables drivers and dispatchers to message each other. Dispatchers send messages from Spare Operations and drivers send messages in the Driver App.

## What is the value?

**Reduce opportunities for miscommunication**: Radios can be chaotic and confusing, with multiple drivers chiming in on the same radio frequency. Messaging reduces radio chatter, ensuring important messages are conveyed correctly.

**Have discreet conversations**: Radios do not allow for private conversations, making it difficult to share sensitive information or address issues discreetly.

## How does it work?

If you have an unread message from a driver, dispatchers will hear a notification and see a blue dot next to the Live Map on the left-hand side. To read the message or respond, you first need to navigate to the Live Map.

At the top of your Live Map, you'll see a new filter option called **Messages**. Pressing **Messages** opens up the Messages side-bar.

Click on the duty to read a message, see the message history between the duty and dispatch, and write a response. From this page, it's also possible to broadcast a message to all active duties. 

Once the message has been sent, the driver will receive a notification in the Driver App. The notification plays a sound, and a blue dot appears on the **messages** icon at the top of the screen.

If the driver presses the **Messages** icon they can see the conversation history with dispatch. If the driver needs to respond, they can choose from the three quick response options (**Yes**, **No** and **Understood**) or write a custom message and press **send**.

> You can only send messages to active duties, which requires the driver to be logged in to the Driver App.

You can now see the message history from completed or cancelled duties in the Duty Itinerary beneath Duty Time Travel.
