<Info>
This article gives you the nuts-and-bolts of Spare EAM so you can hit the ground running. For starters, EAM stands for **Enterprise Asset Management**. Spare EAM is not just for vehicles—it tracks *every asset* that matters: vehicles, lifts, shop equipment, facilities, even fareboxes.

## What is Spare EAM?

Spare EAM is a cloud platform that lets you monitor asset health, schedule preventive maintenance (PM), manage inventory and vendors, and eliminate paper from the garage—all in real-time and on any device.
