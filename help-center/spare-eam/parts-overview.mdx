   - Creates inventory transactions for audit trail
   - Updates PO status (partial, received, etc.)
   - Marks line items as fully received when complete

### Using Parts in Work Orders

**Adding Parts to Work Orders**

1. When creating or editing a work order
2. Add **Parts Line Items** to service tasks
3. Specify:
   - Which part is being used
   - Quantity consumed
   - Source location (where part is taken from)
   - Unit cost for this specific usage

**Automatic Inventory Updates**

- Parts consumption is tracked when work orders are completed
- Inventory levels are automatically reduced
- Inventory transactions record the usage for audit purposes

### Monitoring and Alerts

**Low Inventory Notifications**

- Automatic alerts when parts fall below minimum stock levels
- Organization-wide low inventory reports
- Email notifications to maintenance managers

**Reorder Recommendations**

- System-generated suggestions based on minimum stock levels
- Location-specific reorder alerts
- Historical consumption analysis

**Inventory Reporting**

- Current stock levels across all locations
- Inventory valuation reports
- Parts usage history and trends
- Purchase order status and history

## Best Practices

### Part Setup

- Use consistent naming conventions for parts
- Include manufacturer part numbers for easy reference
- Set realistic minimum stock levels based on usage patterns
- Categorize parts logically for easy searching

### Inventory Management

- Conduct regular cycle counts to maintain accuracy
- Set location-specific min/max levels based on actual usage
- Use bin locations for efficient physical organization
- Monitor reorder alerts regularly

### Purchase Orders

- Establish relationships with reliable vendors
- Include expected delivery dates for better planning
- Use partial receiving for large shipments
- Attach documentation (invoices, receipts) to purchase orders

### Integration with Maintenance

- Link parts to specific service tasks in work orders
- Track parts usage for accurate cost accounting
- Plan maintenance based on parts availability
- Use parts consumption data for better inventory planning

## Understanding the Business Logic

### Inventory Transactions

Every inventory movement is recorded as a transaction with:

- Clear audit trail (who, when, why)
- Source and destination tracking
- Direct links to purchase orders or work orders
- Transaction types (purchase, adjustment, consumption, transfer)

### Stock Level Calculations

- Current stock = Sum of all positive transactions - Sum of all negative transactions
- Reorder needed = Current stock ≤ Minimum stock level
- Available for use = Current stock - Reserved stock (if applicable)

### Multi-Location Benefits

- Optimize inventory distribution across facilities
- Reduce carrying costs while maintaining availability
- Support mobile maintenance teams with portable inventory
- Enable location-specific reorder strategies
