## What are Issues in Spare EAM?

<Info>
**Issues** are records of problems or concerns related to your assets that require attention. They help you document, prioritize, and resolve operational or maintenance challenges efficiently.
</Info>

Issues can be created in two ways:
- **Automatically**: Generated from failed inspection items during pre-/post-trip inspections
- **Manually**: Created by users when problems are identified outside of inspections
