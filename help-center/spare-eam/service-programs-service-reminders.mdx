## How to Use Service Programs and Reminders

### Creating a Service Program

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Service Programs">
    Navigate to the **Service Programs** section in Spare EAM
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Program">
    Click on **"New Service Program"**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Program Details">
    Complete the following information:
    - **Program Name**: A recognizable name for the program
    - **Description**: Details about the maintenance plan
    - **Service Tasks**: Add tasks (e.g., "Oil Change", "Brake Check")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign to Assets">
    Assign the program to specific assets
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Activate">
    Save the program to activate it
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Setting Initial State When Linking Assets

When linking an asset to a service program, you can set initial values that serve as fallbacks for service reminder calculations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fallback Last Service Date">
    - Used as a fallback when no history of service entries are found for the relevant service task
    - Service reminders use this date to calculate due dates if no actual service history exists
    - Defaults to the current date when linking the asset
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fallback Last Service Meter Value">
    - Used as a fallback when no history of service entries are found for the relevant service task
    - Service reminders use this value for meter-based calculations if no actual service history exists
    - Defaults to 0 when linking the asset
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
These fallback values are task-specific. If you complete a service entry for "Oil Change" but not "Brake Check", reminders for "Oil Change" will use the actual service date, while "Brake Check" reminders will continue using the fallback values until that task is completed.
</Warning>

### Tracking Maintenance

Track reminder statuses (Upcoming, Due Soon, Overdue) from the Service Reminder page.

#### Understanding Reminder Calculations

<Info>
Each service reminder is tied to a specific service task and tracks that task independently. This ensures accurate, task-specific maintenance tracking rather than generic asset-level reminders.
</Info>

Key points about reminder calculations:
- When you complete a service entry, only reminders for the service tasks included in that entry are updated
- If no service history exists for a specific task, the system uses the fallback dates and meter values you set when linking the asset to the program
