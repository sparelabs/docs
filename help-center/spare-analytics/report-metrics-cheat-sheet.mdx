| The reason for this is that we incur additional costs each time this piece of data is calculated. ** | - As per **ADA Regulations**, transit agencies must provide a paratransit service that is comparable to its fixed route service. One way of comparing these is by travel duration. Historically, our customers have had to do a lot of this work themselves – manually entering trip details into Google Maps (or something similar) to determine what a fixed route trip would have looked like. |

| Now, we’ve added this as a column available in the Ridership Report (or in any **Custom Report templates**) so transit agencies can easily report on their compliance. | It is calculated using Google Directions’ API and considers the request’s origin, destination, and time & date, but *does not* use real time traffic data. The trip time is displayed in minutes and includes walking time and transfer time if applicable, as well as total in-vehicle travel time. |

The organization’s zones have to be in a city supported by [Google’s Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview#how). If Google can’t find a public transit route from the pickup to drop off point, then this field won’t populate in reports.
