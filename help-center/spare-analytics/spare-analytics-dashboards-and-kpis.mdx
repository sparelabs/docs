  alt="Screenshot of ridership KPIs dashboard"

### Key Ridership Metrics

**Completed Boardings:** The total number of passengers who completed trips. This can be different than the total number of trips (Total Trips), as there can be multiple passengers per trip.

**Average Boardings Per Service Hour: **The mean number of Completed Boardings for each hour that service was available.

**Boarding Cancellations:** The total number of passengers whose trips were canceled.

**Cancellation Percentage: **The percentage of total cancellations out of total trips.

**Cancellation Percentage (No Show)**: The percentage of no-show cancellations out of total trips.

**Total Trips:** Total number of trips that have reached a "final state". This includes Completed, Cancelled, and No Drivers Available trips. Trips that are In Progress or Processing are not included in this number.

**Completed Trips:** The total number of completed trips.

**No Drivers Available Trips:** The total number of trips that the system was not able to fulfill and went to the No Drivers Available Status.

**Request Cancellations:** The total number of canceled trips.

**Request Cancellations (No Show):** The total number of canceled trips due to a No-Show.

**Avg. # of Trips per Rider:** The mean number of Completed Trips per Rider.

**Avg. Travel Duration:** The mean amount of time riders spend onboard a vehicle.

**Avg. Travel Distance: **The mean distance riders traveled while onboard a vehicle.

**Mean Wait Time:** The mean wait time for 'Leave Now' (Rider App) and 'Leave As Soon As Possible (Spare Operations) during this period. 

**Median Wait Time: **The median wait time for 'Leave Now' (Rider App) and 'Leave As Soon As Possible' (Spare Operations) requests during this period. 

**Bookings from Admin Panel: **Percentage of total rides that were booked through the Admin Panel.

**Bookings from Rider App: **Percentage of total rides that were booked through the Rider App.

**Flag Down Bookings:** Percentage of total rides that were booked through Spare Driver.

**Avg. # Riders per Request: **The mean number of Completed Boardings per Completed Request. (There can be multiple riders per request).

**Ridership Graphs**

- Below the KPIs, the Graphs section lets you view a **historical graphical interpretation** of the following KPIs:

**Completed Boardings:** An important metric to measure the relative increase/decrease of the demand and number of individual trips being made. This helps inform capacity, service hours, and expansion.

**Average Boardings Per Service Hour: **A useful metric that shows the average amount of Completed Boardings per service hour. This is useful in seeing when demand is at its highest and lowest; allowing you to better recognize patterns with your service and schedule shifts.

**Boarding Cancellations: **An important metric to measure the relative increase/decrease of the number of trip cancellations. A high proportion of trip cancellations can point to numerous things, including high wait times, lack of capacity, difficulty in riders finding their ride, or other frictions that make the service less convenient or easy to use.

**Average Travel Duration: **The average amount of minutes riders spend onboard the vehicle.

**Mean Wait Time: **An important metric that can inform capacity and/or other technical issues/pain points. This is measured by the amount of time between when the rider wants a trip and when the trip gets fulfilled.

**Median Wait Time:** An important metric that can inform capacity and/or other technical issues/pain points. This is measured by the amount of time between when the rider wants a trip and when the trip gets fulfilled.

**Heat Map**

- In the Maps section, you can view heatmaps that display both **requested** pickups and dropoffs for your selected services and time period. These maps are useful for visualizing where demand is concentrated. To explore how this demand shifts over time, use the "Time Travel" button at the top left to scroll through time and see the heatmap within a 1-hour time window.
