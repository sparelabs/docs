## Enhanced Template Management and Tracking

Analytics 2.0 now includes advanced template tracking capabilities that provide better organization and lifecycle management for your reports and dashboards.

### Template Identification and Versioning

<Info>
All reports and dashboards now include template identification and version tracking to help you manage and organize your analytics templates more effectively.
</Info>

Each report and dashboard is automatically tracked with:

- **Template ID**: A unique identifier that links related reports and dashboards to their source templates
- **Template Version**: Version tracking that helps you understand the evolution and changes to your analytics templates over time

### Benefits of Template Tracking

</CardGroup>

### Template Information Access

Template information is automatically managed by the system and can be accessed through:

- **Report metadata**: View template details when examining individual reports
- **Dashboard properties**: Access template information in dashboard management interfaces  
- **Analytics administration**: Use template tracking for organizational reporting and management

<Tip>
Template tracking works automatically in the background, requiring no additional configuration. This information helps administrators understand analytics usage patterns and maintain better organization across their reporting infrastructure.
