## What is Reservationist Copilot?

Copilot is an AI-powered tool designed to help you speed up common workflows. Reservationist Copilot is specifically designed for the flows that reservationists encounter most frequently:

- **Booking trips**
- **Checking on a rider's trips**

## Booking Trips

Riders often book to and from very similar locations. Copilot has access to a rider's recent trips and knows what a rider is likely to book and at what time. If Copilot has a good enough idea, you'll see this address suggestion when searching for an origin or destination for a particular rider.

## Checking on a Rider's Trips

Getting a good understanding of a rider's trip history can be cumbersome. It requires going through their recent trips and piecing together the story of their experience on your service.

Copilot speeds this up by showing you a **Rider Summary** and **KPIs** at the top of the rider's profile page. Here's what this looks like: 

### Rider Summary
