## Identifying Riders

A rider must always have their most up-to-date phone number and email address entered in their account details, as this is how they will receive ride notifications and Stripe receipts (if that is enabled for your service).

In the case where a rider **updates their phone number or email address**, Administrators and Booking Agents are unable to edit this information in the Spare Platform due to security reasons. Instead of editing, an Administrator or Booking Agent will need to **create a new account for the rider, enter their new details, and delete their old account**.

## Same Named Riders

Often, there can be riders that share the same name. Differentiating between the two then becomes quite difficult. 

Now, when you search for a rider, the information that populates in the dropdown will include email and phone numbers as differentiators.

This will appear wherever you search for riders (when booking a request, searching through a list of riders, etc).

## Deleting Duplicate Riders

You can learn more about how to delete duplicate rider accounts in the article below:

**[Deleting Rider Accounts](/help-center/spare-operations-booking-agents/booking-agents-managing-riders/deleting-rider-accounts)**

- Deleting a rider account will **archive the entire rider profile**; so if you were to search for it, you could not see it. However, it will **not erase the rider's past trip history**
- All rider trips will remain in the database and will still show in the analytics, requests, and reports 

It is recommended that the rider's old, duplicate account be deleted to avoid any confusion when booking trips.
