Phone numbers and emails are some of the main ways to contact riders for trip notifications and organization updates. Spare also uses phone numbers as the main identifier for riders, but phone numbers are not forever (unlike puppies), and there are many reasons why someone could change:

- Lower income riders will use burner phones which could change every 6 months so need to change their number regularly
- People lose and replace their phones and are not always able to keep the same number
- Phone number change for privacy concerns
- People switch to new contracts

## How do you edit phone numbers?

_This section appears to be incomplete in the original document._

## What are the current limitations?

Only Admins can currently change these details. Riders will need to call into the organization to get them changed.

> **Important:** When a phone number or email is changed, riders will be immediately logged out of any devices they are logged into so they can authorize the new number or email.
