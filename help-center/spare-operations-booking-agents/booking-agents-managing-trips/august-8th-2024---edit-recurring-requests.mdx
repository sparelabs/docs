It's now possible to edit the date, time, pickup address, dropoff address and service of requests created by recurring trips! This improvement removes the need to cancel and re-create requests to modify these fields. Here's how it works:

#### What's changed?Previously, if you pressed 'Edit Request and Rematch' on a request that was created by a Recurring Trip, it was not possible to edit the date, time pickup address, dropoff address or service of the request. 

The edit request page looked like this:

With this update, users are now able to edit the date, time, pickup address, dropoff address and service of requests created by recurring trips. Modifications to these fields only apply to the current request, and don't impact other requests created by the recurring trip. The edit request page now looks like this:

This improvement makes it easier for dispatchers and reservation agents to modify requests and removes the need to cancel and re-create requests to accommodate changes. 

If you edit a request created by a recurring trip, any subsequent modifications to the recurring trip will not apply to the request. For example: 

A rider has a recurring trip at 1 pm every day

The rider calls in to modify tomorrow's request to 10 am

Later that day, the rider calls in to modify their recurring trip to 8 am every day

In this scenario, tomorrow's request will remain at 10 am and all other requests created by the recurring trip will be modified to 8 am.
