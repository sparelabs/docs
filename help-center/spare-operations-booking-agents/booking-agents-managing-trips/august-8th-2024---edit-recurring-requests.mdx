It's now possible to edit the **date, time, pickup address, dropoff address and service** of requests created by recurring trips! This improvement removes the need to cancel and re-create requests to modify these fields.

## What's changed?

Previously, if you pressed **'Edit Request and Rematch'** on a request that was created by a Recurring Trip, it was not possible to edit the date, time pickup address, dropoff address or service of the request. 

The edit request page looked like this:

With this update, you can now edit the **date, time, pickup address, dropoff address and service** of requests created by recurring trips. 

> **Important:** Modifications to these fields only apply to the current request, and don't impact other requests created by the recurring trip.

The edit request page now looks like this:

## Benefits

This improvement makes it easier for dispatchers and reservation agents to:
- Modify requests without canceling and re-creating them
- Accommodate rider changes more efficiently
- Maintain better service quality

## How it works

If you edit a request created by a recurring trip, any subsequent modifications to the recurring trip will **not** apply to the edited request. 

### Example scenario:

1. A rider has a recurring trip at **1 pm every day**
2. The rider calls in to modify **tomorrow's request to 10 am**
3. Later that day, the rider calls in to modify their **recurring trip to 8 am every day**

**Result:** Tomorrow's request will remain at **10 am** and all other requests created by the recurring trip will be modified to **8 am**.
