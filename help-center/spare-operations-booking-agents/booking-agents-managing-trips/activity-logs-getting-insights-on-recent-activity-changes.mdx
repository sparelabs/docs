## What is an Activity Log?

An Activity Log is a written record of all recent activities that happened on a specific object.

Activity logs help you:
- Track any minor changes
- Save time recreating the sequence of events
- Allow for a more efficient investigation process

**Retention periods by package:**
- **Base Platform Package**: users can see the last 14 days of actions taken
- **Data & Access Package**: users can see the last 100 days of actions taken

### Request Activity Logs

#### Accessing Request Activity Logs

In **Spare Operations [1]**, go to the **Rides page [2]** and switch to the **Requests Tab [3]**.

From there, open the request you'd like to review.

You can narrow down your search by:

- Searching requests by Riders

## How do the Activity Logs reflect changes?If there are any changes to a request or a duty, the Activity 

Log will be updated and will only display the new values.

### Example 1: Request Time Change

Here's how a request time change is reflected in the Request Activity Log:

1. The request was first edited (you can see in the notes that it happened due to the rider running late)
2. Then the request was rematched and accepted by a driver

![Request Activity Log showing edited request and rematch sequence](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/969278449/9e2736c7082c488e52936f77/pSogpq5luuKBSJgHk6tqHHnI9JbMV3_ImA.png?expires=1753820100&signature=66c3af1d574278082191bbeb827a970710e5ab4a481ea9f8b69ac229dc44bda1&req=fSYuFM52mYVWFb4f3HP0gEZdcr%2FtdUy4Wx4C7pi%2FG0iUcPKEWTx7inJIxpS7%0AT5U%3D%0A)

### Example 2: Duty Time Change

Here's how a shift start and end time change looks like in the Duty Activity Log:
