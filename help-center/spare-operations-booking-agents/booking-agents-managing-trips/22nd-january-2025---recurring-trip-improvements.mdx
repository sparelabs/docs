## **What's changing?**

- When creating and editing recurring trips, you now see a map that displays the pickup and dropoff locations:

It will be possible to edit the address, service and payment method of recurring trips:

Editing the address and service modifies all requests in the Processing or Accepted state related to this recurring trip. 

Edits to the payment method apply to new requests. The payment method of existing requests created by this recurring trip can be individually updated.

We're making it simpler to specify whether an exception day applies to outbound or return requests:
