## From an Existing 

Trip

**Step 1: Find a trip to act as the "blueprint".**

- You can either select an existing trip or create a new one.

Please note that by clicking **Create New Recurring Trip**, the system will copy the specific rider, pickup, and dropoff locations, notes, service, and any accessibility features.

**Step 2: Make sure that the pre-populated information is correct**

**Step 3: Select the days and time**

- Select what days you would like this request to be repeated.

Select the start and the end dates of the recurring trip (You can either let the request run forever or select an end date by unticking the box Forever).

Choose Leave-at or Arrive-by and pick a time.

If you want this recurring trip to have a return trip, untick Return Request Time and choose a time for the return trip.

You can also add exceptions to the rules above by clicking the Add button at the bottom. Create a restriction range by choosing a start and end date for when the recurring trips shouldn't occur.

**Step 4: Save the trip**

- Complete the new recurring trip by clicking Create New Recurring Trip.

## Editing and Deactivating Recurring TripsNavigate to "**Recurring Trips"** under the **Rides** menu. 

Here you will find an overview of all the recurring trips.

Please note that any line here represents a "blueprint" for a recurring trip, not an individual trip request. 

By clicking any of the existing recurring trips you will find the recurring trip details as well as all the requests automatically generated based on the recurring trip.

![recurring trips](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/969337946/92dcd2a64c8bf7285650e5f1/Ein7RwKem3SDhTlXqN0m4RAtbSKSGkDAAQ.png?expires=1753820100&signature=64df0f4c9b877c8d26e5b10597de31f92fce10277f7291d48caf364a18bf37f8&req=fSYuFcp5lIVZFb4f3HP0gH2kR%2BfHDmEXjKmdaQg%2BoMLzXGBNQQGcqcTmhUtY%0AlLg%3D%0A)

From the Recurring Trip page, **Edit[1]** or **Deactivate[2]** the trip. Follow the platform instructions to apply the changes.

**1.** Editing allows you to update the pickup address, drop-off address, service, number of passengers, accessibility features, trip notes, payment method, when it repeats, whether there's a return trip, add exception days and edit custom fields.

ðŸ’³ Changing the payment method will only affect new requests created by the recurring trip. The payment method of existing requests created by this recurring trip can be updated manually.

**2.** Please note that deactivating a recurring trip will delete the entire blueprint. If you instead want to cancel a specific Request created by the blueprint, please select the specific Request and cancel that one.

## How do Recurring Trips Create Requests? Recurring trips use the Service Settings to determine when and how to create requests. The following service settings modify the Recurring 

Request behaviour:

**Recurring Trip Creation Deadline:** Recurring trips will start being created this many days before their requested pickup or drop-off time. The system will continue to try and create recurring trips up to 2 hours before the requested pickup time.

**Recurring Trip Flexibilities: **These service settings define the on-time performance window for recurring trips. [More information](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8994600-service-windows-flexibilities).** **

- It's possible for requests to fail during creation. It's possible to set up Platform User Notifications that inform you when a recurring request fails to be created. [More Information.](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8989058-platform-user-notifications-internal) Often, recurring requests fail to be created due to [duplicate or overlapping requests](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8978827-managing-duplicate-and-overlapping-requests). 

## Importing Recurring TripsTo import recurring trip requests, click the **"Import Recurring Trips"** button (Rides -> Recurring Trips). [More information on 

Imports](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/9081245-importing-data-to-spare).
