The Alternative Routes feature in Spare Labs Admin is designed to assist booking agents by providing additional transportation options alongside Demand Response trips. This includes Microtransit and Paratransit services, where the system offers up to three alternative fixed-route transit optionsâ€”regular buses and trains. The feature emphasizes efficient resource allocation and enhanced rider experience by enforcing conditions based on distance and transfers.

## Key Benefits**Efficiency and Comparison**: 

Allows booking agents to see fixed-route alternatives to paratransit journeys, enabling more informed decisions and potentially more efficient travel arrangements.

**Conditional Eligibility**: Helps agencies enforce eligibility conditions by providing alternative options that meet specific criteria such as the number of transfers and total travel time.

## Alternative Route Criteria**Fewest Transfers**: 

This option prioritizes routes with the fewest vehicle changes and considers the shortest duration when multiple routes have the same number of transfers.

**Shortest Transfer Distance**: Focuses on minimizing the walking distance required during the trip.

**Shortest Duration**: Offers the route with the lowest total transit time.

## Limitations**Accessibility Concerns**: 

The current system does not account for accessibility needs at fixed-route buses, stops, and stations, such as avoiding stairs.

**Data Dependency**: Relies on accurate GTFS feeds, including real-time updates, which can affect the reliability of displayed routes.

**Estimation Errors**: Travel and walk times are approximations and do not consider the variable speeds of different passengers.

**Walking Distance Limit**: Excludes routes that require more than 2 km of walking.

**Exclusion of Demand Response**: Alternative routes do not integrate Demand Response legs.

**Service Zone Restrictions**: Only shows alternatives if both pickup and drop-off locations fall within predefined service zones and times.
