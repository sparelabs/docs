## Cancelling a Request via the Admin PanelIf you cancel a request via the admin panel, by hitting ***Actions*** in the top right corner of any request page. You'll be taken to our 

Cancellations page where you'll be prompted to enter in more context.

Each of these 4 fields, *Fault, Cancelled By, Reason *and *Notes* can all be found as columns in our reporting and are highlighted in *[Spare Analytics.](#h_da45b5d16a)*

## Cancelling a Request via the Driver AppDrivers also have the ability to cancel trips from within the App itself. Spare will default this to logging it as cancelled *By Driver *and will automatically fill in the *Fault *field as *Rider* for *No-Shows *and *Driver* for *

Other.*

*## Cancelling a Request Via the Rider AppWhen a rider cancels their trip via Spare's App - the rider will be prompted to fill out a cancellation reason. Just like the other cancellations it is mandatory for riders to select a reason for cancelling. 

This will fill in the cancellation fault* as none, *cancelled by *as rider and the reason as what is filled in below.

*## Fare Refunds From CancellationsIf a trip is Cancelled where the payment method was not Cash or another form of onsite payment (ie. Custom Punch Pass). 

Spare will reverse* the charge **one hour after cancellation*.***

This will be done automatically to the payment method used for the purchase and doesn't require any action from the rider or Spare users. You can view the Cancelled charge on the *Request page* or in the *Charges* section of Spare Pay.

## Reversing Cancellations and No Shows*Often Cancellations or No Shows can happen by mistake and Spare has the tools needed to reverse these as necessary. These are available in Spare's Dispatch* package if you are logged in as a *Spare Admin* or* Operations 

Manager.*

Using the *Actions Menu* in the top right corner of the *Request Page* you can reverse any *Cancellation* or *No Show* within **one hour **of their trip being declared cancelled or no-showed.

By reserving a cancellation - Spare allows 5 minutes to manually rematch the trip using our Overrides feature, part of the Dispatch Package, before Spare automatically matches it.

When you reserve a No-Show - Spare will automatically move the trip onto the vehicle that was scheduled to pick it up as *In-Progress. *

*## Cancellation Activity LogWithin your Requests page,* you have the ability to filter all of your Trips to find *Cancelled Trips *to get visibility on all Cancelled trips within Spare or combine with other filters, such as *Address, Creation Time, 

Rider etc.*

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1022190923/f52abde538e86296c3262373/Screenshot+2024-04-15+at+13_48_18.png?expires=1753820100&signature=f06514a72bae7f9b60fb34247b49a45f61723845866c494aeda32d9dee45e789&req=dSAlFMh3nYhdWvMW1HO4zTnlLdbL88Qhm4yrADQUx6Vz3amRLHfV8N%2FE4NC4%0AO%2Fj4%0A)

Within each Request you can also find the details of any Cancellation at the bottom of the Request page.

*## Cancellation AnalyticsSpare Analytics also displays all of the high level information about your total number of Cancellations/No Shows* as well as the *

Percentages, *based on number of total riders that were booked but not picked up.

All of Spare's Analytics can be narrowed down based on *Services, Fleets and Date Ranges* and we've written up a whole article on how to Use [Spare Analytics](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8957135-spare-analyze-dashboards-and-kpis) here!

## Exporting Raw Cancellation DataWe know not everything can be done within Spare's analytics dashboard and it's possible to export Cancellation information out of Spare by tailoring some of the steps from Spare's [Exporting 

Guide](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8957210-downloading-reports)

Start by Creating a New Report and Choosing the Ridership/Requests Metrics Report.

There are hundreds of columns to choose from but the Main information regarding cancellations is found under the *Request *columns section and is highlighted below.
