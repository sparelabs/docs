When booking a ride on behalf of a passenger, the Booking Agent or Dispatcher can deem the trip to be one of three things: 

**Leave as Soon as Possible: **Trips will be booked to pick up the rider immediately. The accuracy of the driver getting to the stop right away will depend on their current manifest and the scheduling of other rides. 

**Schedule Request to Leave-At:** Trips will be booked with the intention that the driver will pick up the rider to Leave-At a certain time in the future. This could be minutes or hours ahead on the same day, or at a certain date and time later on. 

**Schedule Request to Arrive-By: **Trips will be booked to drop the rider off at their stop at the time designated when booking an Arrive-By trip. Then, the Spare algorithm will determine what time the rider will need to be picked up to fulfill their drop-off time request  

**Please Note:** The time estimates may vary between the booking **Estimation Window** and the **Trip Confirmation Window** based on your services set flexibilities. 

You can read more about service flexibilities in our[ Service General Set-Up article](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8988085-service-general-setup).
