## What is a multimodal journey?

A multimodal journey is a trip that requires multiple legs, and it could be a combination of your on demand and fixed route services. 

## How do I book a journey?Head to the same page that you always use to book trips in Spare Operations, and being by inputting the same information (rider, origin, destination). 

If the trip can be fulfilled by combining services into a multimodal journey, you'll see this option:

Select this and enter the time for the trip. Once that's complete, you'll see the multimodal journey options on the right, just like a standard trip:

These journeys can be a combination of your on demand and fixed route services. They include information about when the rider should be initially picked up, where their connections are, and when they'll arrive at their ultimate destination. These journeys can have none or multiple on demand legs. 

For journeys with no on demand legs, you don't have to book anything, simply inform the rider over the phone of the information they need for their trip. 

For journeys with one or more on demand legs, you'll need to book it so the on demand vehicle gets sent to them. Once it's booked, you'll be brought to the standard "request page" with one key difference:

Did you spot it? That blue button that says "View entire journey" will allow you to see all the legs the rider has for this journey:
