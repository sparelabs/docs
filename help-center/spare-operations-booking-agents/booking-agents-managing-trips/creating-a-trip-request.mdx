## Creating a RequestCreating a trip request on the Spare Platform is easy.

| Select Rides in the left menu; | In the dropdown, verify that Requests is selected; |

In the top right, click Add Request;

**Step 1: Getting to the request booking page:**

| From anywhere, you can click the search bar in the top left, or press CMD+K on your keyboard to open Superbox. The first action here is to Create a Request.  | ![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/wyxobwoi/1250946706/1965553507776a5222d36405a318/Screenshot+2024-11-13+at+1_35_08%E2%80%AFPM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=ca213fdf63f60a45890dbca17c4675638860564710526b733ccc9c0e0a79dba5&req=dSIiFsB6m4ZfX%2FMW1HO4zVImqe9XXpj4bCicfXpWUT5EYPkW2sFWTd1ZD9lv%0AZ5jb%0A)Or you can be on a rider's individual page and click "Add Request" in the top right to start making a request for that rider.  |

**Step 6: Select a Payment**

- If payments are enabled for the service, **select a relevant payment **method for the user. Depending on payment options available, this could be Cash, Credit Card, or a Mobile Ticketing option.

If cash is not an option, and payment is required, select **Add Credit Card** with **Spare Pay IVR**. After selecting this option, an automated system will call the rider and request that they input a credit card

| Take a look at the table below to learn when each status appears: | | **Status**  || **Explanation** |
|------------|-----------------|

- Processing

The matching process is updating the request based on the latest information regarding driver availability.
​
​

| With "Leave-at" requests operated by Open Fleets, the request will first go into the Processing status and remain in it until 10 minutes before the requested pickup time. | No Drivers Available |

| The matching process did not find any drivers for the passenger to match with. | Accepted |

| The request has been accepted into a driver's duty. | Service Disruption |

A previously Accepted trip is no longer matched to a duty. 
​
| This can happen if a dispatcher manually chooses to rematch the trip to a different driver, if the duty has been cancelled, or if an Open Fleets driver cancels the trip and it attempts to find a new match. | Arriving Soon |

| Arriving Soon is used to notify the rider that the driver is near their pickup. The notification & state is set when both of these conditions are true: | - The current time is less than 4 minutes away from the scheduled pickup time |
- The driver is less than 2 minutes drive away

| Note: this status is only used for on-demand services. | Arrived at Pickup/Dropoff |

| This status is used to calculate OTP & Lateness in the platform. The arrived state is set when both of these conditions are true: | A. The driver is 300m away from pickup |
| B. The current time is within 15 minutes of scheduled pickup. | Very occasionally it takes longer than 2 minutes to drive 300m (e.g. in busy city areas), so it is possible for the ‘Arrived at Pickup’ state to trigger before the ‘Arriving Soon’ notification is sent to the rider. This doesn't affect the functionality or experience of the rider or driver. |

| Trip in Progress | Trip is in progress. |

| Cancelled | The request has been cancelled. To find more information about the specific cancellation reason, navigate to the detailed information regarding the specific request. |

| Trip Completed | The trip/request was completed by a driver. |

| Spare has recently added **Dispatch Statuses **so that you could have more transparency into what exactly is going on with the request under the Processing status. | ![](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/969372045/e3e64577eb8002fa8beac40a/xz7lM2CxGKUCg8_v1WRIowrMtXJLyvNjgg.png?expires=1753820100&signature=1456fbc8aa2de5749db9f055bca1364f82f6d0f57eb95ef4068232dc75c51671&req=fSYuFc58nYVaFb4f3HP0gFcNa5j5tp4SDQef7V7qsY1FHjOZqXxuDGxN8xpe%0ALlo%3D%0A) |

| Here are the Dispatch Statuses a request can have | | **Status**  || **Explanation** |
|------------|-----------------|

- Awaiting Dispatch

| This request has not yet finished dispatching - e.g. the request has been created, but we either haven't yet started the process of dispatching it to a fleet/duty, or the first dispatch attempt is in progress. | Offered to Fleet |

| An offer has been sent out to a fleet where a driver can choose to accept it or not (like an Open Fleet or Accept/Reject fleet). We have not yet heard back from them | Unmatched |

| There isn't currently a spot on a duty for this request, but we're going to keep trying to find one. Examples of how requests could get into an unmatched state: | Stayed processing/service disruption instead of going to NDA due to the no strand policy being enabled |

| The request was added even though we knew there was no room ("unmatched request") | "Delayed matching" request that doesn't have a tentative match |

| It's too early to send an offer yet to an accept/reject fleet, but we'll try again later | Initial dispatch failed, but we've scheduled a follow-up dispatch attempt |

| Arriving Soon | Arriving Soon is used to notify the rider that the driver is near their pickup. The notification & state is set when both of these conditions are true: |

- The current time is less than 4 minutes away from the scheduled pickup time
- The driver is less than 2 minutes drive away

| Note: this status is only used for on-demand services. | Tentatively Matched |

| We have a tentative match for this request, but service rules dictate that we shouldn't yet notify the rider, as our system may unmatch it. | ## What are Alternative Trip Times?When booking rides in Spare Operations, it’s common for the rider’s requested time to be unavailable.  |

| When this happens, we now show alternative pick-up and drop-off times close to the rider's desired time.  | The display of these trip estimates depends on  |

| Alternative trip times speed up the booking & negotiation process for reservation agents & riders. | ## When are Alternative Trip Times displayed? |

| To see alternative trip times, all of the following conditions must be met: | The service selected must be using the “Consistent Windows” [Scheduled Pickup/Dropoff Window Type](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8958837-what-is-scheduled-pickup-dropoff-window-type) to surface those time estimates. This new service configuration is much more intuitive and a better fit for ADA compliance. |

| The trip time is ‘Leave At’ or ‘Arrive By’ - we don’t display multiple estimates for “Leave as soon as possible” trips | The estimate for the ‘requested time’ returned ‘No Drivers Available’ |

## How many estimates do we show?

The number of alternative estimates displayed depends on the type of trip:

**Leave At:** If the requested time is not available, we will display up to 5 estimates (requested pickup time & 2 estimates on either side). The estimates are based on the flexibilities of the service.

| E.g. If a service has a forward flex of 30 minutes and backward flex of 0 minutes, and the rider requested a pickup at 2 pm, we would display 5 estimates: | 1 pm-1:30 pm pick-up |

1:30 pm-2 pm pick-up

2 pm-2:30 pm pick-up

2:30 pm-3 pm pick-up

3 pm-3:30 pm pick-up

| E.g. If a service has a forward flex of 15 min and backward flex of 15 min, and the rider requested a pickup at 4 pm, we would display 5 estimates: | 2:45 pm-3:15 pm pick-up |

3:15 pm-3:45 pm pick-up

3:45 pm-4:15 pm pick-up

4:15 pm-4:45 pm pick-up

4:45 pm-5:15 pm pick-up

**Arrive By:** If the requested time is not available, we will display up to 3 estimates (requested drop-off time & 2 estimates prior)

| E.g. If a service has an arrive-by backward flex of 30 min, and the rider requested to be dropped off at 2 pm, we would display 3 estimates: | 1:30 pm-2 pm drop-off |

1 pm-1:30 pm drop-off

12:30 pm-1 pm drop-off

## Which locations are displayed as recent address suggestions?

| The ordering of recent address suggestions is based on the frequency that the rider has gone to and from the address and by the addresses that the rider has used recently. | ## |
