As one of the most heavily used pages in the Spare Platform, it's important for the Add Request page to be easy to use. We've made several improvements to this page that we're excited to roll out to all customers by **July 16th, 2024. **

- In the video above, you'll see these key changes: 

## More Information About the Rider![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1109652995/7b12e7a524048336344c5592/Screenshot+2024-07-10+at+4_22_40%E2%80%AFPM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=0185cbf90ffaa77e69b2ef25153d50759836d2e4373119ea309e5bc92e45be3e&req=dSEnH897n4hWXPMW1HO4zWynGVzVHDMok2G469rXxb85wNXWHMtvSk%2Fval9b%0AM0L7%0A)Once you've entered the rider, you might want to double check information about them. Now, you can easily click on "View" to bring up the rider's details, without leaving the Add 

Request page.

You can also see where your service area is at the same time, helping to answer the question of "is this trip actually within the service area"?

## Improved Button Styling![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1109656816/17c2d63405455aa2442b6e10/Screenshot+2024-07-10+at+4_31_12%E2%80%AFPM.png?expires=1753820100&signature=560c87bb54c3f1b744f0a2ed3ef48af5e1be20e57b09576f95f74e261501147a&req=dSEnH897m4leX%2FMW1HO4zTtVJ5O0pJlH96lEs9PAa1z6xD%2FbhquLxmVAIxwl%0A4xxY%0A)

These improved buttons make it easier to ensure you've selected the correct option, helping to reduce errors and prevent mistakes.
