**Please Note: **The following information is applicable for Spare customers using **"Automatic Search Windows"**. Please speak to your Spare Representative to learn more, or visit this [link](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8958837-what-is-scheduled-pickup-dropoff-window-type).

When booking a trip in the Admin Panel or Rider App, you will be presented with a trip duration estimate.

A **Trip Duration Estimate **includes an estimated window for the pick-up time, an estimated window for the drop-off time, and an estimated trip duration window. Based on the flexibilities set for the service, these windows may be tighter or more open.

In the trip booking process, the rider, dispatcher, or scheduler will be presented with trip estimate times. These times **should be used as an approximation to provide an idea of when the pick-up and drop-off windows will be.**

Although trip estimates do provide a strong prediction of the trip parameters, **some factors can change the times between the moment a trip is in the booking process, and after it has been confirmed. **These factors include other booking details, vehicle lateness, vehicle connection, duty pausing, duty scheduling, and ride demand.

For these reasons, we advise riders, dispatchers, and schedulers to view the time estimates merely as that and to **provide the riders with the actual trip times after receiving their confirmed trip details.**
