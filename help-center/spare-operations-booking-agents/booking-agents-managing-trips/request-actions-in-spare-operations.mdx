Your job isn't done when the request is created! You need to manage it through to completion. That's where request actions come in. Request actions are available everywhere that you can see requests: 

Request Details Page

Requests List

Duty Itinerary

Live Requests 

The following actions are available to  users: 

## Edit Request and RematchAny trip in the '**Accepted**', '**Processing**' or '**Arriving** **Soon**' states can be edited. Pressing "Edit and Rematch" will open the request booking page. 

From here users can edit the trip:

Rider

Service

Number of riders

Accessibility Features

Trip Type ("Leave at", "Arrive by" or "Leave as soon as possible") 

Accessibility features

Custom Fields

Dropoff Location

[Lock To Duty](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8967347-locking-requests-to-duties) 

If the updated request can be accommodated, trip details will be returned as an estimate on the right-hand side. In the example below, an additional 3 riders were added to the request.

To move forward with the adjusted trip request, **"Save Request & Rematch" **needs to be selected. This can be found at the bottom right-hand corner of the page. **Once pressed, Spare will make the edits and automatically remove the request from it's current duty. **

- Spare then will evaluate all possible matching options (based on the serviceâ€™s set parameters, such as trip flexibility) and move the request to the best possible duty. It's possible to keep the request on its current duty using [Lock to Duty](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8967347-locking-requests-to-duties?q=lock). 

#### Limitations of Edit & Rematch: If you have [unmatched requests disabled](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8994566-unmatched-requests), and there are no available duties to match the request to, the request may go to No Drivers 

Available. 

Editing a trip may result in the fare changing. If the rider paid with a credit card and the fare increases, we will cancel the previous hold an create a new one for the increased amount.

[Fleet Providers](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8984472-fleet-sharing) can Rematch requests but are unable to edit them or view estimates. 

It is now possible to edit & rematch Open Fleets trips. More info on this [here](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8967377-moving-a-trip-request-to-a-new-duty#h_8a03d8df17). 

## Edit Notes and Custom FieldsIt's possible to edit the notes and [custom fields](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8994536-custom-fields) of trips in all states. 

This option enables users to quickly edit the details of a request without rematching it.

## Create Recurring TripFor more information, please consult the [Recurring Trips](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8979021-creating-and-editing-recurring-trips) Help 

Article. 

## CancelTrips in the '**Processing**', '**Accepted**', **Arriving** **Soon**' and '**In** **Progress**' states can be cancelled. After pressing 'Cancel', fill in the information in the form and click Create Request Cancellation. 

Cancelling a request also cancels any credit card holds that were placed for the request. 

## Rematch from Open FleetIf you have dispatched a trip request to an Open fleet provider, such as Lyft, Uber, Uzurv, or Taxi providers, and the trip is in Processing, Accepted, or Arriving status, you can now rematch the request to a different or the same service. 

This functionality provides you with the convenience and efficiency that you are accustomed to with rematching trips dispatched to dedicated vehicles.

Please note:

Requests dispatched to an Open Fleet currently cannot be rematched to the same fleet, and can only rematch to vehicles in other fleets. If no vehicles belonging to another fleet are available to rematch to, the request may need to be cancelled and re-created before it will match.

A cancellation fee may be incurred if one is levied by the Open Fleet Provider, such as Lyft, Uber, or Uzurv.

## Edit MetricsðŸ’¡ This feature is included in the Data Analyst Pro package. Please reach out to your Spare 

Representative for more details.

If a trip is in the 'Completed' status, it is now possible to edit the data to ensure your financial and regulatory reporting is accurate. More information on this feature can be found in the **[Data Reconciliation and Editing Trip Data](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8988659-data-reconciliation-and-editing-trip-data) **article**.**

# Dispatcher ActionsðŸ’¡ Dispatcher Actions are included in the Dispatch package. Please reach out to your Spare Representative for more details.

Our dispatcher actions enable dispatchers to react to unexpected situations that arise during service. Many of these situations are caused by mistakes from reservationists or drivers, like booking a trip with the wrong pickup/drop-off location, or a driver picking up the wrong passenger.

## OverrideThe "Override" request action can help you move a request from one duty to another. This action is shown for requests in the 'Accepted' or 'Arriving Soon' status. Clicking Override opens the [override flexibilities](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8959245-override-flexibilities) feature, and pre-selects [Lock to 

Duty.](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8967347-locking-requests-to-duties?q=lock) 

## Find MatchThe "Find Match" request action can help you move a request onto a duty. This action is shown for requests in the 'Processing' status and 'Unmatched' or 'On Hold' dispatch status. Clicking Find Match also opens the [override flexibilities](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8959245-override-flexibilities) feature and pre-selects 'This Requests' and 'Other 

Requests' to give the system the best chance of finding a match. 

## Fix LatenessThe "Fix Latenss" request action can be used to ensure a trip is completed on time. This action is shown for 'Accepted' and 'Arriving Soon' requests. Clicking Fix Lateness opens the [override flexibilities](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8959245-override-flexibilities) feature and pre-selects 'Other Requests'. 

This will generate a fresh estimate for the request and give the system the option of overriding other requests to get it completed on time. 

## Unmatch RequestThis action is available for all 'Accepted' requests. "Unmatch Request" unassigns the request from its duty and moves it back to "Processing". The request is then held in "Processing" for 5 minutes. 

After 5 minutes the system will try to rematch the request to a new duty.

## Complete Pick-upUsers can complete the pick-up of '**Accepted**' and '**Arriving Soon**' requests in Spare Operations. The action lets you specify a completion time and location for the pick-up. The completion time and location must be within the service hours and zones. 

In addition to this:

The duty must be 'In-Progress' 

The Service Zone must be 'door-to-door'. You cannot use Complete Pick-up for Stop-based zones.

The duty cannot be in the 'No Connection' state 

## Complete Drop-offUsers can complete the drop-off of '**In-Progress**' requests in Spare Operations. The action lets you specify a completion time and location the drop-off. The completion time and location must be within the service hours and zones. 

In addition to this:

The duty must be 'In-Progress' 

The Service Zone must be 'door-to-door'. You cannot use Complete Drop-off for Stop-based zones.

The duty cannot be in the 'No Connection' state 

## Reverse Pick-upReverse Pickup allows dispatchers to reverse a pick-up that was completed by a driver. Any in-progress trip can have its pickup reversed. The reversal re-creates the pickup slot on the driver's itinerary and moves the trip back to accepted. 

It is not possible to reverse the drop-off if:

The request's duty is completed or cancelled

The duty is in the 'No Connection' state

There is not enough space in the vehicle to accommodate the passenger

## Reverse Drop-offReverse Drop-off allows dispatchers to reverse a drop-off that was completed by a driver. Any in-progress trip can have its drop-off reversed. The reversal re-creates the drop-off slot on the driver's itinerary and moves the trip back to 'In-

Progress'.

It is not possible to reverse the drop-off if:

The request's duty is completed or cancelled

The duty is in the 'No Connection' state

There is not enough space in the vehicle to accommodate the passenger

## Edit Drop-off

It's possible to edit the drop-off location of an in-progress trip if:

The new drop-off location is within the service area

The new drop-off time is within the service hours

The Service Zone is 'door-to-door'

The driver's tablet is connected (the duty is not in the 'No Connection' state)

## Reverse CancellationIt is possible to reverse the cancellation of a trip less than an hour ago. Reversing the cancellation will move the trip back to 'Processing'. 

Spare will evaluate all possible matching options (based on the serviceâ€™s set parameters, such as trip flexibility) and move the request to the best possible duty. 

If you have [unmatched requests disabled](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8994566-unmatched-requests), and there are no available duties to match the request to, the request may go to No Drivers Available. 

## Reverse No-ShowLet's say, the passenger showed up right when the driver hit the cancellation button. You can easily reverse the no-show in the request actions list. Reversing a No-Show will move the request back onto the Driver's duty and complete the pickup. The system will update the trip to be 'In 

Progress'.

It is not currently possible to reverse a no-show completed more than one hour ago. It's also not possible to reverse a no-show if the trip was in progress before it got cancelled.
