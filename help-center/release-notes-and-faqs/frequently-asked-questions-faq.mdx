## Payment Processing & Billing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is a rider charged for their trip?">
    When a rider books a trip using a Stripe Card, here's how the payment process works:

    **During Booking:**
    - Stripe places a **hold** on the rider's credit card for the corresponding fare amount

    **After Trip Completion:**
    - Spare instructs Stripe to convert the hold into a **charge**, debiting the amount from the rider's card

    **If Trip is Canceled:**
    - Spare instructs Stripe to cancel the hold **one hour** after cancellation
    - This delay allows users in Spare Operations to reverse the cancellation if it was made by mistake
    - Once Stripe cancels the hold, it may take several days for this to be reflected on the rider's card

    <Warning>
    Stripe cannot place holds on cards for more than **7 days**. Therefore, by default, riders cannot use Stripe Cards to book rides on Spare more than 7 days in advance.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
    If you wish to allow riders to book rides using Stripe Cards more than 7 days in advance, Stripe can immediately debit the funds from the rider's account when the trip is booked and refund them in the event of a cancellation. Please contact your Spare representative to enable this functionality.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="If a payment is fully processed through Stripe and the trip is subsequently cancelled, does Spare automatically issue a refund?">
    **Yes**, even for fully processed payments, Spare can issue a refund when the trip is cancelled. 

    This means that regardless of whether the payment was:
    - Just a hold on the card, or
    - Fully captured/processed

    Spare ensures that the charge is refunded upon trip cancellation. This process is handled **automatically** to ensure a seamless experience for users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How would a trip cancellation refund be handled if your wallet is already at its maximum balance?">
    <Check>
    In this situation, we will **permit your wallet balance to exceed the maximum limit**.
    </Check>

    This means that if you cancel a trip and the refund is credited to your wallet, your balance can go above the usual cap. This ensures you receive your full refund without any issues.
  </Accordion>

## Driver Operations & Communication

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="For Driver to Rider calling, what number do riders see when receiving a call?">
    When a driver calls a rider:

    **Privacy Protection:**
    - The rider's phone number remains **hidden** to protect their privacy

    **Caller ID Display:**
    - The rider will see the call coming from the **same number used for SMS and voice notifications**

    <Info>
    This ensures consistent communication channels while maintaining rider privacy and security.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the required proximity to the scheduled start location for a driver to begin their duty?">
    Currently, there are **no specific limitations** regarding the proximity to the scheduled start location for a driver to begin their duty. 

    This means that drivers can start their duty **regardless of their distance** from the start location.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a specific amount of time a driver can be late for pullout before Spare stops assigning trips to them?">
    **Yes**, there is a threshold for lateness:

    **When Driver is Late:**
    - Spare will begin **unassigning trips** from that driver shortly after the trips become sufficiently late

    **Purpose:**
    - Ensures that trips are reassigned to other drivers
    - Maintains timely service 
    - Minimizes delays for passengers

    <Warning>
    Late pullouts can significantly impact service quality and passenger experience.

## Analytics & Reporting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do the heatmaps in Analytics reflect completed stops or requested pickups and dropoffs?">
    The heat maps in Analytics reflect **requested** pickups and dropoffs, **not** completed stops.

    **Purpose:**
    - Show where **demand is concentrated** based on customer requests
    - Reflect data from your selected time period
    - Help identify high-demand areas for service planning

    <Note>
    These maps are designed to show demand patterns rather than actual service delivery locations.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the definition of an 'active' request?">
    A request is classified as **"active"** if it meets **both** of the following conditions:

    **Status Requirements:**
    - Has a status of: `Accepted`, `Arriving`, `In Progress`, `Processing`, or `Service Disruption`

    **Timing Requirements:**
    - The scheduled pickup time (`requestedPickupTs`) falls within **30 minutes** of the current time

    <Info>
    If both criteria are satisfied, the request is labeled "active." Otherwise, it may still be considered "ongoing" or "scheduled," but will not be flagged as "active" in the app.
    </Info>
