## Creating a Project

To create a new Project in Realize, navigate to the Realize tool in your **sidebar**. A list of your existing Projects will be displayed in a table. Click on **'+Add Project'** in the top right corner.

3. Once your Project has been created, a new page is displayed, where you have a choice of actions to take:

- **Edit Project** - Gives you the option to rename the Project
- **Duplicate Project** - Creates an exact copy of the Project and all its contents, including Services, Zones, Fleets, and so on
- **Delete Project** - Permanently deletes the Project from your profile. A warning notification will ask you to confirm this action, as it cannot be undone
- **Run Project** - Allows you to enter the Realize platform to view your data, build services, and so on. This is your door into the wonderful world of Realize!

## How to Return to the Project?

Once you have created and built services in a Project, you may want to return to it at a later date. To do so, navigate to the Projects page in Realize, either by:

- Clicking on the Realize icon in your left sidebar
- Clicking on the Projects hyperlink in the top left corner

Click on the row with the project name.
