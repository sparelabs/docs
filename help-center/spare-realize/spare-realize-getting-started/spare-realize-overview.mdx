This document is designed to get you up and running with Spare Realize. It summarizes the key steps to setting up a project and getting some results.

## Getting Started with Spare Realize

### Start a Project

Navigate to the Realize tool in your sidebar, and [create your first project](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8952603-create-and-edit-a-realize-project). Once you're in a project, you can always return to the main projects page.

### Explore Your Datasets

Before you begin your simulations, make sure you have helpful Datasets for your area of interest. You can easily visualize them in the [Data Layers](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8953369-visualizing-datasets) tab. If you don't have the right Datasets, feel free to request them!

### Visualize Fixed Routes

On-demand transit doesn't exist in a vacuum, so it's important to understand how your planned service could fit within the fixed route system. It's easy to [import and visualize Fixed Routes](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8953316-visualizing-fixed-routes).

## Set Up Simulations

It's time to get your hands dirty with building out a service simulation! Follow these key steps:

### 1. Set Up a New Service

You need a Service to start designing zones and predicting demand.

### 2. Configure Service Zones

[Set up a new Zone](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8955012-setting-up-service-zones-in-spare-realize) for your Service. Zones are the fundamental geographic units upon which on-demand systems are built. You can always export or delete a Zone if needed.

### 3. Build a Demand Model

[Build a Demand Model within your Zone(s)](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8953600-building-a-demand-model). This is one of the most complex parts of Realize, so take your time! You can either build the Demand Model manually or ask Realize to do the grunt work for you. You'll have to set the Adoption Rate, which controls how popular your service might be, as well as the Service Hours and other parameters.

### 4. Create and Connect Fleet

[Build a Fleet](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8953581-creating-fleets-in-spare-realize) and then make sure you connect the Fleet to your Service. This ensures you are supplying vehicles to the demand you simulated in the previous step.

### 5. Adjust Advanced Settings

If you're feeling brave, [delve into the Assumptions](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8953562-adjusting-assumptions-underpinning-a-simulation) tab to fiddle with some more advanced simulation parameters.

## Analyze Results

You've worked hard to set up your simulation, so it's time to understand how your service is behaving, and how you could improve it!

### Visualize Trips

[Visualize the trips](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8952597-visualizing-simulated-trips) that Realize has predicted might occur thanks to your Service.

### Explore Impact

[Explore the impact](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8951752-exploring-the-impact-of-your-service) of your service using the key performance indicators (KPIs) and financial savings calculated for you by Realize.

## Iterate and Export

### Keep Iterating

A central feature of Realize is that it lets you rapidly iterate on your ideas. If the results don't quite hit your objectives, go back to the Demand and Supply stages, pull some different levers, and see if you can come up with a more optimal solution!

### Export Results

Once you're happy to share your service plans, you can easily [export your key results](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8951745-exporting-the-results) in a variety of formats.
