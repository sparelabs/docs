Visualizing General Feed Transit Specification (GTFS) data in detail is essential for understanding how your on-demand transit designs interact with fixed-route transit.

Start by importing any GTFS data that is present for your area of interest. Click on the **'Fixed Routes'** tab in the** 'Service'** panel. Then click on** 'Import Fixed Routes'**.

Any GTFS datasets that have been pre-uploaded for your area are now shown. **Click on the dataset of interes**t to select all the services in the GTFS file. Alternatively, click the down arrow to the right to select/deselect individual services in the GTFS file.

Then, click on **'Import Fixed Routes'** to import your selected fixed-route services to your Project. 

All the selected routes in the services are now displayed in a table in the Fixed Routes tab. The table summarizes the name and colour of the route, the agency, and the number of stops along the route.

**Toggle individual lines** on and off to visualize them on the map. You can also toggle all lines on/off at the same time using the toggle in the table header.

The routes are coloured by the colour code specified in the GTFS if it is supplied, otherwise, they are shown as a default blue colour.

***Please note that if a 'shapes.txt' file is not supplied in the GTFS file, the routes may be improperly snapped to actual roads.***

**Clicking on a route **– either in the Fixed Routes table or on the map itself – opens up a sidebar that provides you with more information about that route. You can also delete the selected route from your Project by clicking on 'Delete Route'.

Additional elements of the fixed routes can be displayed by clicking on the **'Map Controls'** button on the map. Toggling on the** 'Stops'** shows all fixed route bus stops associated with each selected route.

In the same** 'Map Controls'** menu, you can toggle on **'Route Frequency'** to visualize how frequently a route is visited by a bus. The darker lines represent a higher frequency, and the lighter lines represent a lower frequency.
