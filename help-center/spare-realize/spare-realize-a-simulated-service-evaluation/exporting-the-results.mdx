Once you have designed your ideal prototype service, it's vital to share your ideas with colleagues and external stakeholders. Realize makes it quick and simple to export the data and images in your Project.

## Starting the Export Process

To export the data in your Savings and Service KPIs tables, or to generate an image of your current map view, click on **'Export Results'**.

<Note>
The current map view will be used to generate an image. If you want a different view, navigate to your desired view using the map itself, before you click 'Export Results'.
