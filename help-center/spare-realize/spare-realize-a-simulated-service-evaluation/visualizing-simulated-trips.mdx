Once you have set up a Service and connected it to a Fleet, Realize generates likely trips within your Zone(s), which are fed into a model to evaluate the performance of the service.

Each trip is made up of an origin (e.g. a home) and a destination (e.g. a restaurant), and each trip is given a likely timestamp throughout the day.

## Enabling Trip Visualization

To visualize these simulated trips throughout the day:

1. Click on **'Map Controls'** in the top right of your screen
2. Toggle on **'Example Trips'**

## Understanding Trip Display

Trips are displayed as arcs connecting **the origin (in green) and the destination (in red)**. You can **zoom in and out** of the map to investigate their exact locations. Right-dragging with your mouse allows you to rotate around the map.

## Controlling Trip Timeline

A slider is displayed at the top of the screen. **Expand the left and right buttons** at the end of the slider to cover a longer time in the day, and use the central button to scroll and reveal trips at different times of the day.
