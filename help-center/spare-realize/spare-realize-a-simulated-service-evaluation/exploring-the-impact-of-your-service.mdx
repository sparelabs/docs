Once you have gone through all the effort of building your Service, connecting your Fleets, and checking the assumptions of your simulations, itâ€™s time to get some results!

Realize breaks down the impact of your Service into three main themes: **the Service Summaries**, **the Service KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators), and **the Savings**.

## Service Summaries

Navigate to the **Service Summaries tab** in the left-hand sidebar, once you have connected **at least one Fleet** to your Service. This provides **high-level insights about your Service(s)**, including Zone characteristics and a breakdown of the simulated Trips.

## Service Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Next, **navigate to the Service KPIs** in the left-hand sidebar. This displays key information about the **experience of the Service for the rider**, as well as a summary of **Fleet and vehicle information**.

## Savings Analysis

Finally, navigate to the **Savings sidebar.** This provides **a full breakdown of the costs and benefits** of each Service in your Project, split into Agency, Societal, and Environmental Savings. Scroll to the bottom of this tab to see a summary of the return on investment (ROI) of your Service(s).
