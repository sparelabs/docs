title: "Adjusting Assumptions Underpinning a Simulation"
description: "Learn how to customize the underlying assumptions in your Spare Realize simulation to better reflect your specific region and improve result accuracy"
---

All simulations are underpinned by a set of assumptions about the society, environment, and transportation system outside of the on-demand service you have built.

Adjusting these assumptions to better reflect the simulated region will help to improve the accuracy of the results.

## Accessing Simulation Assumptions

To customize these assumptions:

1. **Navigate to the Assumptions tab** in the **Project Settings**
2. Progress down the page, altering fields if you have the appropriate data

<Info>
Realize provides default values for all fields, based on the most realistic data available for your region.

## Resetting to Default Values

If you make an error when changing the fields and wish to return to the default values:

1. **Click the 'Reset'** button in the blue box
2. A warning message will appear
3. **Click 'OK'** to confirm the reset
