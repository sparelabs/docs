Once you have created one or more Fleets, they must be connected to a Service to supply it with vehicles.

## Connecting a Fleet

1. Navigate to the bottom of the **Service** tab
2. Click on **'Add Fleet Connection'**

![Add Fleet Connection button located at the bottom of the Service tab](/images/spare-realize/simulation-mode/add-fleet-connection-button.png)

3. From the dropdown menu, **select the Fleet you wish to connect to the Service**

<Info>
If a Fleet is connected to multiple different Services, the total vehicle hours associated with that Fleet will be divided proportionally to each connected Service based on the ridership in each service. A Service with more ridership will capture more vehicle hours from a Fleet than a Service with fewer vehicle hours.

If you need to **remove a Fleet connection** from your service, click the trash can icon on the right.
