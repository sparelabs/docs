In Spare Realize, fleets represent groups of vehicles that operate together. This guide walks you through creating and configuring fleets for your simulation.

## Getting Started

To create a new fleet in Spare Realize:

1. **Navigate to the Fleets tab** in the right sidebar
2. **Click on 'Add Fleet'** to open the fleet configuration sidebar

## Fleet Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Name Your Fleet

Give your fleet an **informative name** that clearly identifies its purpose or characteristics.

### Step 2: Configure Shift Parameters

**Enter the total number of driver shifts** (Realize takes this to mean the total number of vehicles in your Fleet), and **the average shift length** of each driver shift. The blue box calculates the number of vehicle hours the Fleet is supplying, by multiplying the number of shifts and the average shift length.

<Note>
Realize does not currently allow you to create a complex shift schedule (including breaks) for your Fleet. This is to ensure simple and robust simulations, but may soon change.
</Note>

### Step 3: Set Additional Parameters

Enter **additional parameters** in the fields below the blue box, which mainly control the operational and capital costs associated with each Fleet.

## Adding Multiple Fleets

**Repeat these steps** to add as many Fleets as necessary for your simulation.

<Warning>
Your Fleets are not connected to a Service until you explicitly connect a Fleet in the Services tab.
</Warning>
