## How to Create a Service Zone?

Once you create a new Service, it needs to be assigned to a specific geography.

At Spare, we refer to service areas as **'Zones'**. Click on **'Draw New Zone'**. This takes you to a new sidebar.

### Drawing Your Zone

Start by **drawing your Zone**. As the helpful hint suggests, you can draw the Zone yourself by clicking on the map in the shape you desire. 

<Warning>
Make sure you finish drawing your Zone by clicking on the first point you drew, otherwise the Zone will not be completed.
</Warning>

Alternatively, **if you already have a Zone shape generated** using an external different GIS package, you can **upload** that Zone shape as a shapefile (*.shp) or geojson (*.geojson). Click the Zone upload icon in the blue bar at the bottom of the map view and follow the on-screen prompts to click and drag your file into Realize.

### Naming Your Zone

Give your Zone an **informative name**.

### Selecting Zone Type

Select your **Zone Type** from the dropdown menu:

- **'Door to door'** means your Zone will allow travel between any locations of a rider's choosing.
- **'Closest stops'** means your Zone will only permit pickups and dropoffs at pre-specified stops.

#### Configuring Closest Stops Zones

**If you select 'Closest Stops'**, a couple of additional options will appear in the sidebar.

**Select your Stop Source** in the dropdown menu. Selecting **'Generated by Realize'** as a Stop Source will automatically generate stops in the most popular locations, up to the number of stops you specify in the **'Number of Stops Required in Zone'** field. Realize warns you about how many of your required stops could be automatically generated, in a smaller grey font below the field.

##### Manual Input Options

**Selecting 'Manual Input'** as the Stop Source reveals a Stops table. Click **'Add Stop'** below the table and select **'Add New Stop' or 'Import Stops'** from the dropdown menu.

**'Add New Stop'** is a manual option, which allows you to create a Stop anywhere within your Zone by clicking on the map. Make sure to give your Stop a numerical code and name. You can delete any Stop by clicking on 'Delete Stop' at the top of this sidebar.

Clicking on **'Import Stops'** will allow you to **bulk import stops** from a CSV file. A popup will guide you through this process.

### Setting Zone Direction

Next, select the desired **Zone Direction** for your Zone. 'Pickup and dropoff' means both pickups and dropoffs are permitted in the Zone. The alternatives are 'Pickup only' and 'Dropoff only'.

<Info>
You can repeat this Zone creation process as needed: there is no limit to the number of Zones you can create in a Service!

## How to Delete a Zone

**To delete a Zone, simply click 'Delete Zone'**. It will now no longer appear in the Zones table in your Service.
