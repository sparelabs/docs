Once you have built your **Demand Model**, you need to configure when and how your service operates.

## Setting Service Hours

Set the hours during which your service operates using the slider on the Service Hours graph. The shape of the graph represents the likely distribution of trips throughout an entire day, based on your Demand Model.

<Info>
The grey text below the graph indicates how many of the potential trips are covered by the service hours.

Additional service parameters can be set below the graph including:

- **Average trip fare for the service**
- **Detour Flexibility of the service**
