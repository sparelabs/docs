In this article, you will find answers to the following questions:

- What is OpenStreetMap and how does Spare use it?
- Why would I edit OpenStreetMap and how do I do it?

## What is OpenStreetMap?

The Spare Engine uses data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to create the route for a trip.

OpenStreetMap is a community-driven project and this gives you the ability to update the map information when necessary. Once you update the map on OpenStreetMap for your service area, let us know so we can refresh the data for your Service.

## Why would I need to edit OpenStreetMap?

**The primary reason to make a change to OSM is incorrect data. **

- Occasionally, OSM will have inaccurate or out-of-date information. In that case, you may want to make a change so that the map better reflects reality. This could be a new traffic pattern, a “No Left Turn” sign, a road that is closed to vehicle traffic, or anything else that may come up.

**What if the change in OSM is not due to incorrect data?**

- If you want to avoid/**remove a road from the route **of a trip for reasons beyond global changes, we will export an osmChange file rather than save the changes permanently in OSM. 

For example, if your vehicle doesn't fit down a certain road, the Spare team can upload the osmChange file to your geography so your drivers will not be routed down this road. The change should not be saved to OSM as the road still exists and other OSM users can use this road.

## How can I make permanent & public changes to OSM?

Changes saved in OSM must be long-term and impact all users for upwards of 6 months.

In our case, we will look at an intersection in Vancouver that no longer allows left-hand turns (from Broadway to Main). This change is both permanent and public as the city has implemented this change.

1. Go to [www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
2. Login or **Register** (it's free and easy to set up an account)
3. Search for the **address** you want to work on and click **"Edit"**

Select the intersection that needs to be updated. On the left-hand side of your screen, there will be a section called **“Turn Restrictions”. **Select the “From” road.

You will see a green, blue, or red arrow. Cycle through until the arrow is red and the window shows **“NO Left Turn”.**

When you are finished editing, you will need to save your work.  Select the **“Save”** option on the top right-hand side of your screen.

**Add a comment** about your change.

Select** “Upload”.**

- Congratulations! You have successfully made an update to OpenStreetMap.

Before the change is visible in your account, we will need to update our records. Please send an email to your **Partner Success Manager **to let them know that you have made a change.

## Example: A road that is no longer accessible

Another example is a change to a road that no longer accepts motor vehicles. 

Select the section of the road in question.

In the menu on the left-hand side, scroll down to a section called **“Allowed Access”**

- Next to **“Motor Vehicles”** choose the dropdown and select **“No”**.

After you make the edit, select **“Save” **in the top right-hand side of the screen.

Type a **comment**.

Select **“Upload”**.

## How do I make private & permanent changes to OSM?

If a **private change** to OSM is necessary to change the routing for your drivers, the change **shouldn't be saved in OSM**. Instead, an **osmChange file should be downloaded** and sent to your **Partner Success Manager**.

The process of exporting the changes is quite similar to the process of saving the osmChange file:

Once you are done making the changes unique to your organization in OSM, you can hit save in the top right corner.

Scroll to the bottom of the menu and select** "Download osmChange fle"**

Email your osmChange file to your** Partner Success Manager**

**Do not save your changes in OSM!**

## Example: A road is too small for a bus to turn“What should I do if there is a road that is too small for my bus to drive down? Standard vehicles are still permitted, but 

I want to make sure that it is not used for routing.”

It is important to remember that OpenStreetMap is used by many different groups and that accuracy is very important. That said, a change can be made but not saved with the following procedure:

Turn off motor vehicle access to the road.

Save.

Select 'Download osmChange file' at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.

Then refresh the page (without pressing save again) and select 'Reload' on the popup.

OpenStreetMap will then highlight that you have 'unsaved changes'. Here you need to select 'Discard my Changes'Please send an email to your **Partner Success Manager**, with the osmChange file with a description of the change made.

This way you can operate without that particular road and OSM remains accurate.

## How do I make private & temporary changes to OSM?

- There may be instances of shorter-term road closures that will impact routing in your operating region. An example of this would be a week-long festival that causes a temporary road closure.

Please reach out to discuss scheduled closures with your** Partner Success Manager** well in advance of the closure occurring, as removing a road from OSM temporarily could impact advanced bookings and a stop zone may need to be created surrounding the closed area so riders and drivers can still connect.
