- How to add conditional eligibility criteria to rider groups
- How to add a rider's conditional eligibility to their group membership
- How does automated eligibility enforcement work for reservation agents?
- How does automated eligibility enforcement work in the Rider App?
- How can I communicate important information like a rider's eligibility criteria and service level to Riders and Drivers in Spare Rider and Driver?

## How does automated eligibility enforcement work in Spare Rider?

If a rider has unmet conditions or restrictions when booking rides in the Rider App, the services they are unable to ride are displayed with an explanation of why the rider is unable to book the service at that time.

## How can I communicate the rider's eligibility criteria and service level to Riders and Drivers?

It is now possible to add custom fields to Group Memberships. Each custom field can be configured to be:

- Visible to riders or drivers
- Editable by riders

This allows agencies to control the information that riders and drivers see about the rider's eligibility. For example, you can enable both riders and drivers to see the rider's service level (hand to hand, door to door, curb to curb) in the driver app and rider app. Here's how it works:

### How do I create a group membership custom field that's visible to riders?

### What do Group Custom Fields look like in the Driver App?

Group Custom fields can be seen under the 'Notes' in the 'Group Details' section in the Driver App. 

This screen is accessed by pressing the blue 'info' button on the request in the driver app.
