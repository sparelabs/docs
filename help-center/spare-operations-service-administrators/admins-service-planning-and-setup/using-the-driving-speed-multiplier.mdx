## What is Driving Speed Multiplier?Driving Speed Multiplier allows you to **modify the driving speed** of **all drivers in your organization** by adjusting the value **between 0.75 and 1.25.** 

With a higher value, drivers will drive faster, resulting in reduced traffic, and vice versa.

The configuration adjusts the speed of the fleet in relation to the speed of a typical vehicle.

Depending on the value of the multiplier, here's the impact it makes:

If the value of the multiplier is **>1**,** **then the Spare Engine will assume **less** travel time is required.

If the value of the multiplier is `<1`, then the Spare Engine will assume **more** travel time is required.

## How do I set it up?Please, ensure you have the Driving Speed Multiplier enabled for your organization. Reach out to your Spare 

Representative for more details.

To configure the Driving Speed Multiplier, go to your** Settings** [1] in Spare Operations. Switch to the **Organization** tab [2] and adjust the multiplier value [3]. Click **Save** to enable the changes.

If you accidentally put the values outside of the recommended window (0.75 - 1.25), the system will give you a warning message.

# FAQ**I decreased the multiplier but now all my trips are showings late, why is that?**

- If a customer has lots of trips being booked up to 7 days out, the Live Map and Live Requests will show lots of lateness for the 7 days after the multiplier is decreased. This is because the schedules will be overpacked relative to the new driving speeds. 

**What increments can this multiplier be changed by?**

- The minimum is 0.5 and the maximum is 2.0. Incremental changes can be made between those numbers. These changes can be made to any decimal point, but our recommendation is to adjust by 0.01-0.05 at a time.
