title: "Strategies to Increase OTP"

---

Lower-than-expected On-Time Performance (OTP) is a common occurrence during the initial days of a new service. As both drivers and riders adjust to the system, it's expected that OTP will gradually increase over time.

However, there are strategies that can be implemented to expedite this improvement process. In this article, we will explore various methods to enhance OTP for new services and ensure a smoother experience for both drivers and riders.

**Analyze Travel Estimates: **
One of the first steps to identify the causes of late trips is to examine duty time travels and evaluate if the travel estimates were accurate. By comparing estimated travel times with the actual travel times, you can determine if any discrepancies lead to delays.

**Collect Drivers' Feedback:**
Speak to drivers to learn if they were arriving late or riders showed any confusion or had a hard time finding a vehicle

**Check Rider Notifications: **
Make sure the notifications are set and the selected mode of communication and triggers are correct. Find out more about Rider Notifications [here](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8984355-rider-notifications).

**Examining Trip Data: **
Investigate the trips that were running late and try to determine the reason. Use trip [activity logs](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8978837-activity-logs-getting-insights-on-recent-activity-changes) to start.

**Consider Configuring Boarding Times and Wait Time Threshold: ****Go to your service settings and check the base boarding time & additional accessibility boarding time**. For that, open the service settings, go to the editing mode, and click on the "Rider Options" drop-down. Check if the boarding time can be reasonably increased so that the drivers have enough time to pick up/drop off riders.

Then check if the** Wait Time Threshold** (how much time a driver should wait before they mark a rider as a No-Show) can be reasonably lowered. For that, go to the fleet settings and view the Wait Time Threshold parameter. Adjust if needed.

**Allowing Time for Adjustments: **
Launching a new service involves a learning curve for both drivers and riders. As the service matures and users become more accustomed to the system, OTP is most likely to improve organically. Monitor the performance closely, but also allow a grace period of a few days for the service to stabilize and adjust before implementing major changes.
