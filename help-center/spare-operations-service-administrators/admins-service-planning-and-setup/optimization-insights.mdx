## What is Optimization Insights, and what's its value?Optimization Insights is a simulation tool** **that lets customers analyze how a previous day’s trips would have gone if the 

X setting was changed.

Many Spare settings impact rider experience and system efficiency:

Duty schedules (how many duties, when they're scheduled, etc.)

Flexibility windows (accepted flex, detour flex, etc.)

Fleet sliders

The driving speed multiplier

Boarding times

Optimization Insights aims to let you get to an ideal configuration much faster, with much less pain. **It enables you to answer questions like, "If I changed settings X and Y, how would last Thursday have worked out?"**

- There are two processes the Optimization Insights feature relies on:

Gathering data about duties/requests from the past day

Running [Global Optimization](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8946518-spare-engine-go-gold-and-targeted-optimization) on the day's duties/requests, but with changes to service settings, fleet settings, number of duties, or driving speed, so you can see the impact the settings changes would have

## What does it look like, and how does it work?To access Optimization Insights, select **Service Planning** and click **Optimization 

Insights**.

The first step in creating a simulation is to make changes to the Setup, Fleets, and Services tabs. Switch between the tabs to adjust the settings. You can start all over by clicking "Reset all Values" in the top right corner.

Once you're done, click "Simulate changes". You might need to wait up to 1.5 minutes for Spare to collect the related data and run Global Optimization.

Results will show a comparison between the simulation result and the past value from your chosen date.

## **

- What does each of the results mean?**

**Boardings Per Vehicle Hr. **

- The mean number of Completed Boardings for each hour that the vehicle was scheduled

**Duties **

- The number of duties scheduled on the day in question.  This will only ever change if you make use of the “Duty Reduction Percentage” feature.

**Pooled Trips Ratio **

- Percentage of trips where a passenger shared their ride with another passenger (that isn't included in their request). 

For example, if Susie books a trip with Jim, this isn't a pooled trip. But if Susie books a trip and Jim separately books a trip and they ride together, this is pooling. 

**Avg. Drive Duration per Duty (hr) **

- The mean number of hours spent driving by each duty. Time spent at stops (boarding/un-boarding), on break, or idle is not counted, only time spent driving.

**Avg. Drive Distance per Duty (mi) **

- The mean distance driven by each duty - using the same criteria as drive duration

**Completed Requests **

- The total number of ride requests that were dropped off. A request can contain multiple riders.

**Unmatched Requests**

- The total number of ride requests that could not be matched to a duty.

**Avg. Time from Desired per Request (min) **

- For Leave-at requests, the mean difference in minutes between the request’s Requested Pickup Time and the Scheduled Pickup Time.

Arrive-By requests use dropoff time instead of pickup time.

**Avg. Detour Time per Request (min) **

- The mean difference in minutes between the scheduled trip time, and the estimated trip time of a direct route.

E.g. if we could get drive you directly from your pickup to dropoff in 20 minutes, but due to pooling-related detours, it’ll take 35 minutes, and detour time is 15 minutes.

## Are there any limitations to using Optimization Insights? **Note:** Currently, Optimization Insights uses Global Optimization Data from a single day. It takes into account all completed duties/requests and runs a Global Optimization on the current settings. 

Because every day varies slightly, we advise running simulations on data from multiple different days to reduce the likelihood of anomalies.

Often, agencies judge success based on OTP (On-Time Performance). This is currently *not* one of the output metrics in Optimization Insights. A potential proxy is “Avg. Time from Desired per Request”.

There is currently no way to save or view past simulations. 

## F

AQ#### **How does the optimization insights tool gather the "Past Value" data? It seems to vary each time, even with the same inputs.**It uses completed duties/requests. 

It is normal that you get slightly different results each time - it runs a 75 second “global optimization” on the current settings and the altered settings each time, and “global optimization” is non-deterministic, as in it won’t always come up with the exact same answer.

Subsequent runs don’t affect each other, but if you keep running over and over again with the same settings, you will get slightly different results each time. They should be similar, but not exactly the same.

#### Are there particular types of organizations where Optimization Insights works best? Yes, Optimization 

Insights will yield the most accurate results for: 

Larger organizations (10+ daily duties, the more the better). If there are too few duties, there isn't much to change / optimize. 

Organizations that want to optimize their auto-accept fleets. Because Optimization Insights doesn't take into consideration accept/reject fleets or Open Fleets, organizations who rely heavily on these will not have actionable results. 

Organizations that have fairly "homogenous requests". This means that most requests can fit on most duties / vehicles. 

e.g. if for 70%+ of requests, it’s possible for that request to match to 70%+ of duties active at the time of the request, this is a good fit for Optimization Insights

Highly subdivided setups (a tonne of disconnected zones, kept fully separate from one another by service/fleet/zone setups) are not a good fit for Optimization Insights

Organizations that don't make heavy use of fixed routes in Spare. 

Organizations that are interested in fleet efficiency rather than increasing demand. This tool can help to cut shifts, pool more, etc, but it does not give tips on how to get *more* trips in the first place. 

It only considers requests that were completed, and how you could have served those requests better

For now, it doesn’t consider things riders who looked for an estimate, but didn’t book (because they got an NDA on the estimate, or the wait time was too long, or …), which tends to be the focus of orgs looking to increase demand

If your organization fits all the criteria above, this will be a great tool! If you're unsure, please speak to your Spare Representative to learn more.
