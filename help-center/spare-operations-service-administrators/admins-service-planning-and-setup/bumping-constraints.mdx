At Spare, we want to provide our riders with a reliable and convenient transportation experience. However, we understand that unexpected changes to scheduled trip times, known as "bumping," can be frustrating for riders. 

In this article, we will explain what bumping entails, its different types, and how our bumping constraints work to mitigate these situations.

## What is "Bumping"?​"

Bumping" refers to the situation when a rider's scheduled trip time is changed in a drastic and unexpected manner.

The impact of bumping depends on how far in advance the change occurs.

If a scheduled pickup time changes by a few minutes but is communicated well in advance, it may not be a significant issue as long as it falls within the rider's flexibility window. 

If the change occurs just minutes before the expected pickup time, it can disrupt plans more substantially.

## Types of Bumping

There are two distinct types of bumping that riders may encounter:

**Bumping into the past: **This occurs when a rider's scheduled pickup time is moved earlier.

For example, if Ann was initially scheduled to be picked up at 10:07 AM but her trip is rescheduled for 10:01 AM, she may be unpleasantly surprised because she needed those extra minutes to walk to her pickup location.

**Bumping into the future:** This happens when a rider's scheduled pickup time is pushed back later.
​
For instance, if Joe is waiting at a bus stop, expecting to be picked up at 10:02 AM, but his trip is rescheduled for 10:12 AM, it can be an unpleasant surprise for him, as he could have spent those extra 10 minutes in a warm and dry coffee shop.

## Understanding Bumping ConstraintsTo minimize the occurrence of bumping situations, we have implemented "bumping constraints." 

These constraints restrict the time ranges within which the matching algorithm can reschedule trips. 

Here's how these constraints work:

**Bumping Into Past Constraints:**

- If a rider is scheduled to be picked up in less than 7 minutes, we "lock" that scheduled time into the past. This means that the pickup time cannot be rescheduled earlier.

If a rider is scheduled to be picked up in less than 2 hours, we "restrict" the length of time it can be rescheduled into the past to 1/6th of the remaining time until the scheduled pickup. In other words, if a pickup is scheduled in 60 minutes, it can be moved up to a maximum of 10 minutes earlier.

**Bumping Into the Future Constraints:**

- If a rider is scheduled to be picked up in less than 2 minutes, we "lock" that scheduled time into the future. This prevents the pickup time from being rescheduled later.

## Which slots and requests are affected?

Bumping constraints apply only to pickup slots.

By definition, in a given run of matching, it applies only to slots belonging to pre-existing requests.

The Bumping Constraints feature is, by default, enabled across all organizations. However, bumping constraints can be selectively disabled. We encourage you to contact your Partner Success Manager for more information.
