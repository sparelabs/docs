## Detour Flexibility

### Description:

Detour flexibility settings allow you to control how much extra time a rider can spend in a vehicle to accommodate pickups and drop-offs for other passengers.

There are four key parameters you can configure:

**Minimum Allowed Detour**
The minimum detour time that can be added to any trip, regardless of its original length. This ensures every request has some tolerance for deviation.

**Maximum Time in Vehicle**
The system will attempt to keep each rider’s total time onboard below this limit.

**Detour Basis**
You can define how the system calculates allowable detours using one of the following methods:

**Direct Drive & Multiplier**
The detour allowance is based on the direct drive time between the rider’s pickup and drop-off, multiplied by a set percentage.
*Example:*
If a direct trip takes 30 minutes and the multiplier is 50%, the rider can be detoured up to 15 additional minutes (30 x 0.5) to accommodate other passengers.

**Fixed Route Equivalent & Multiplier**
The allowable time in vehicle is based on the duration of the fastest equivalent fixed-route journey, multiplied by a set percentage.
*Example:*

Direct drive: 30 minutes

Fastest fixed-route equivalent: 60 minutes

Multiplier: 120%

Maximum time in vehicle: 120 minutes

The rider may be kept onboard for up to 72 minutes (60 x 1.2), as long as it’s within the max vehicle time.

**Note:**
Higher flexibility settings generally lead to longer trip durations but also increase the likelihood of pooled rides.
