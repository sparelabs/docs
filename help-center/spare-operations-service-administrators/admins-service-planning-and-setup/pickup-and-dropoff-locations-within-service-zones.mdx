This feature enhances the rider experience by validating pickup and dropoff locations in real-time during the booking process. It provides immediate feedback if a location is outside the service zone, allowing riders to make adjustments without delay, ultimately streamlining the booking flow.

# How does it work?## **Enter Locations**

- When riders input a location, the system instantly checks if the location is within the designated service zone.

If a location is outside the service zone or in a separate service area, a notification appears directly in the booking interface.
​

## **Map Interaction**

- On the map view, areas outside the service zones are clearly marked or greyed out, preventing selection.

If a rider selects a location on the map that is outside the valid zones, an error message is promptly displayed.
​

## **Correcting Errors**

- The system offers suggestions for nearby valid locations when possible.

Riders can drag the pin on the map within the valid zones to fine-tune their pickup or dropoff points.
