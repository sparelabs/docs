In this article, you will find answers to the following questions:

- What are Time Rules and how do I apply them?
- How do I add a new Time Rule?
- How do I edit/delete an existing Time Rule?

To find out how to create Special Service Hours or Free Fare Days, check the articles below:

[Special Service Hours](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8994077-setting-up-special-service-hours-holidays-and-special-hour-days)
[Free Fare Days](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8989413-creating-a-free-fare-day)

Time Rules dictate the operating hours for each Zone in your Service. This means that the pickup or dropoff time of a trip request must always fall within the time rules you set for the Zone the trip is being booked in. Spare will not allow pickups or dropoffs that fall outside of the selected time rules.

### **Access Time Rules**

To access Time Rules, select **Service Planning** on the left side menu and then choose **Time Rules** from the dropdown.

You'll see a list of all of the Time Rules that have been created for your organization. You can search for an existing rule, or create a new Time Rule by clicking **+ Add Time Rule** in the top right.

You can add as many different rules as you would like–weekdays versus weekends–as long as they are **mutually exclusive and do not overlap**.

You can also add [Special Hours](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8994077-setting-up-special-service-hours-holidays-and-special-hour-days), eg: exclusion dates/hours. Special hours allow you to set days and times where your service has modified hours, or no service at all.

Once complete, click **Create New Time Rule**.

### **Edit Time Rules**

You can **Delete** or **Edit** your rule by selecting the appropriate button in the top right when a Time Rule has been selected.
