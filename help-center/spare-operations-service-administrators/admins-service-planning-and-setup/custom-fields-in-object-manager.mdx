Then, select one of the types that you want to add and follow the steps below.

## Types of Custom Fields**

- Text**

A versatile text field where the Rider, Driver, or Admin can input any free-form text. This field is ideal for notes, descriptions, or any other textual information.

**Number**

- A field dedicated to numerical inputs. The Rider, Driver, or Admin can enter any numeric value, such as quantities or distances.

**Toggle**

- A simple switch that allows the Rider, Driver, or Admin to indicate a binary choice, such as yes/no, on/off, or true/false.

**Single Choice**

- A dropdown or radio button selection where the Rider, Driver, or Admin can choose only one option from a list of predefined choices. Best for scenarios where only one answer is valid, such as selecting a category or status.

**Multi-select**

- Similar to the Single Choice field, but allows the Rider, Driver, or Admin to select multiple options from the list of predefined choices. Useful when more than one option may apply, such as selecting multiple tags or categories.

**Date**

- A field that provides a date picker, allowing the Rider, Driver, or Admin to select a specific date. Ideal for tracking specific dates, such as deadlines, appointment dates, or birthdates.

**Date & Time**

- Extends the Date field by including a time selector, enabling the Rider, Driver, or Admin to choose both a date and a specific time. Suitable for events that require both date and time information, such as meeting times, delivery schedules, or start and end times.

**Single File Upload**

- A field that allows the Rider, Driver, or Admin to upload a single file, such as an image, document, or any other type of file. Commonly used for collecting documents, images, or other files where only one file is needed, such as a signed document.

**Multiple File Upload**

- Allows the Rider, Driver, or Admin to upload multiple files at once, offering flexibility when multiple documents or images need to be submitted. Useful for situations where several related files need to be uploaded, such as scanned forms, photos, or documents.

**Address**

- A specialized field designed to capture complete address details, including first / last name, street address, city, state, and postal code. Ideal for collecting location information, such as mailing address, or key locations.

**Drawing**

- A field that allows the Rider, Driver, or Admin to create a drawing or sketch directly within the platform. This can be done using a mouse, stylus, or finger, depending on the device. This field is commonly used for collecting signatures.

Select one of the types you want to add

**Label** - Type in Label as a placeholder

**Required** - Select "Yes" if you want to make the field required

**Available to Rider Interface** -You can choose between "View and Edit", "View only", and "Not visible" options

**Available to Driver interface** - You can choose between "View and Edit", "View only", and "Not visible" options

**For Single Choice and Multi-select** - The steps are the same as above except for the option to add a choice shown below.

**Searchable - **For custom fields attached to `Rider` or `Request`, admins can select whether that field is “Searchable”. If this is set to “Yes” that means the admin can search in the Request and Rider lists using data from that Custom Field. This only works for Custom Fields that are dates, text, or numbers.

Note that administrators can toggle whether Group Custom Fields are visible to riders and drivers. The first example below references a field that is hidden from riders and drivers, and the second shows a custom field that the riders can update and drivers can see.

## Duty Custom Fields*Duty Custom Fields cannot be seen in the Rider or Driver 

App.*

*For admins, they cannot be set to “view only” or “not visible”. They are just always editable and viewable in Spare Operations. The only thing that would change the ability for a user to edit a duty custom field would be their user permissions.*

## Where do I find Custom Fields in Reports?![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1046727372/93eed4963cce66e46499ffcb/Untitled.png?expires=1753820100&signature=5acf7c86b75af18dbe2afcc60ce473a6a4c4726625c3e0bbd0fe306c27f94805&req=dSAjEM58moJYW%2FMW1HO4zUto8iqW47Rqn%2FDxVCI4%2Bv%2By6GpkV5eAj8ynQVys%0ANTfG%0A)Custom Fields are available in Reports grouped with each object. 

Just select the custom field that you want to include in the report and continue with the process as usual.

## **Custom Field Use 

Cases**## Rider**ADA 

Eligibility**
This would be a field on the rider’s profile to show a booking agent if they are eligible for ADA trips.

**How did you hear about us?**
This could be a single-choice pick list included when a rider signs up for the service. Custom fields for riders are included in the ridership export and this information would help when trying to understand the efficacy of different marketing channels.

## Driver**Driver’s Licence 

Number**
The driver could be asked to include their licence number as part of the onboarding process.

## Group Membership**

- Special consideration reason**

Why has this rider been added to the group? Is there something non-standard about this case that should be noted?

## Vehicle**

- Vehicle registration expiration date**

It could be helpful to record the date that the vehicle registration needs to be renewed.

## Service**

- Main administrator name**

A field that will let everyone with access to Service Planning know who is responsible for managing this service.

## Request**

- Reason for riding
​**What is the rider’s reason for riding? This could be especially helpful for requests created from the Admin Panel as the data may help with optimization and cost saving.

**Fare exception reason**
A single-choice pick list for booking agents to note why a rider was not charged a fare.

## Duty**Pause/Cancellation 

Reason(s)**
What was the reason the duty was paused or cancelled?
