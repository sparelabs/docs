The Arrive-By Pickup Time Flexibility Type is a service setting that only affects arrive-by trips, replacing the Detour Flexibility for these trips.

Arrive-by trips are a helpful tool when booking trips for riders who need to get somewhere by a fixed drop-off time, eg: going to work, a medical appointment, or event. When this trip type is selected Spare Engine works to ensure that rider shows up prior to their desired drop-off time.

## **Why use Arrive-By Pickup Flexibility instead of Detour Flexibility?**Arrive-By Pickup 

Flexibility addresses both of the following issues:

**For riders:**

- With Detour Flexibility, Riders can be given extremely large pick-up windows and expected to be ready for the entirety of the window

If a rider is picked up early and a subsequent rider no-shows the rider would be dropped off at their appointment extremely early.

**Paratransit Agencies:**

- The FTA guidelines state that agencies need to provide ‘equitable’ experiences for arrive-by and leave-at trips. Having long pick-up windows for arrive-by trips and short pick-up windows for leave-at trips creates inequity and may cause the agency to be penalized by the FTA.

What does it look like?**## When configuring a service:

In service setup, you'll see a dropdown with the two flexibility types.

Choosing Pickup Flexibility Only reveals a new field called “Arrive-By Pickup Backwards Flexibility”. This allows agencies to define how big they want their pick-up windows for arrive-by trips to be. If an agency chooses this setting, Spare will no longer consider Detour Flexibility when creating arrive-by trips. 

In this situation the agency has set a 30 minute pick-up window for arrive by trips:

Note that Detour Flexibility will continue to apply to Leave At trips.

## **When booking a trip**With Arrive-By Pickup Backwards Flexibility, Spare displays Pickup and Drop-off On-Time 

Performance windows on the estimate and request:

## **Impact on Live Requests and reporting**For both settings, the Drop-off OTP window is still the ‘relevant’ OTP window for arrive-by trips. The Drop-off window is used for all OTP reporting in Live Requests and Spare Analytics. The Pickup OTP window is not used in any OTP calculations. If “Pickup Flexibility 

Only” is enabled, it is possible to see the pickup window for a trip in the ridership report.

## **Impact on Pooling****Detour Flexibility 

Only** will result in higher pooling as the system has more flexibility and control over when it can pickup riders.

**Pickup Flexibility Only** will result in lower amounts of pooling as the system has less control over when it can pickup riders.
