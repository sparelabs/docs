In this article, you will find answers to the following questions:

What is Spare Optimization Package and how does it work?

What current settings can I change to optimize my service efficiency?

## Spare's Optimization PackageSpare is committed to helping you decrease operating costs while increasing on-time performance (OTP). To improve your results even more, we’ve developed an 

Optimization package – a set of features that work together to increase your service efficiency.

Here’s what you will find in the Optimization Package:

**Global Optimization (GO): **this feature will automatically shuffle around in the background, from one vehicle to another, in order to maximize the efficiency of the overall trip schedule prior to the start of your day’s work.

**Global Optimization of Live Duties (GOLD):** this feature takes a step further and optimizes trips in real time, adjusting active duties and rematching trips if needed. This can accommodate driver delays or newly open space due to cancellations. Safeguards are also in place, such as preventing optimization of a trip if a driver is already on their way.

**Target Optimization: **this feature looks every minute for late trips and attempts to rematch them. Significantly increases OTP.

**Dynamic Driver Breaks: **this feature automatically manages driver breaks according to your fleet’s policy. The system auto schedules breaks, adjusting them dynamically for maximum schedule efficiency as duties fill with trips. Real-time optimization adapts break scheduling throughout the day, maintaining efficiency in response to daily events.

**Optimization Insights:** this feature helps you utilize your organization’s real trip data for simulations and see immediate effects of setting changes on performance. Quickly understand and compare impacts on PPVH, deadhead, detour time, pooling, and more. With Optimization Insights, you can experiment and implement in no time.

## Other Configurable ParametersTo ensure your service is as efficient as possible, Spare Engine considers multiple parameters and constantly shuffles and adjusts different elements to fit the picture. 

While many features seamlessly work in the background, there are a couple of parameters you can try adjusting on your end.

Remember that you can always contact your Partner Success Manager to discuss your unique situation and develop the optimal solution.

## **Driving Speed Multiplier**Driving Speed Multiplier allows you to modify the driving speed of all drivers in your organization by adjusting the value **between 0.75 and 1.25.** 

With a higher value, drivers will drive faster, resulting in reduced traffic, and vice versa.

Basically, the configuration adjusts the speed of the fleet in relation to the speed of a typical vehicle. Depending on the value of the multiplier, here's the impact it makes:

If the value of the multiplier is **>1**, then the Spare Engine will pack duties tighter.

If the value of the multiplier is **`<1`**, then Spare Engine will leave more slack in a duty.

To configure the Driving Speed Multiplier, go to your **Organization Settings** (1) in Spare Operations. Switch to the **Organization tab** (2) and adjust the **multiplier value** (3). Click** "Save" **to enable the changes.

![Spare Launch Screenshot. Service Settings. Driving speed multiplier](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972932463/d8ef6dc84957a5b035417633/M0AIfyfJHi4Dx76GjJzEpVrgxdO7HwXQJw.png?expires=1753820100&signature=a3a80b3dce25585d3ba4b117bd3e53c5e8ff28b512a3b9fc3c0cc5162056dd04&req=fSclH8p8mYdcFb4f3HP0gCt0R8aduRbE9aTnS7SvWgzQxowgvlfdu%2F39BxN8%0AzYw%3D%0A)

If you accidentally put the values outside of the recommended window (0.75 - 1.25), the system will give you a warning message.

Driving speed multiplier settings](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972932464/fcbf506c54950885ad83c272/_JM7xVEQ1oprdUIGjnuj_F4faJdR4-NmEw.png?expires=1753820100&signature=4ff8a49978f08ac0c821fc8ac4f12306f2cfec58476db6a9ae23a08c57a97c73&req=fSclH8p8mYdbFb4f3HP0gDUsH5RneXvBmlEPv81ECid1GaF%2BjmAXJElO9abg%0AUCw%3D%0A)

## **Service Settings: Boarding Times**One of the ways to help more trips fit into the schedule is by lowering Boarding 

Times.

There are two types of Boarding Times in Spare Operations:

**The Base Boarding Time** is the amount of time added to any stop where riders are picked up or dropped off. If a stop has pickups or dropoffs from multiple services which have different Base Boarding Times, the longest of the boarding times is used as the base for that stop.

**The Accessibility Boarding Time** is the amount of time added on top of the Base Boarding Time and is applied when an accessibility feature (e.g., a wheelchair) is required for a particular trip. If there are multiple accessibility features being picked up or dropped off at a stop, Accessibility Boarding Time is added for each one, ensuring there's enough time to load and unload every accessibility feature.

To configure the two settings, go to the **Service Planning** tab and select the service you’d like to **edit**. Then, go into the **Rider Options** tab. Edit the Base Boarding time and the additional boarding time for each Accessibility feature (if applicable).

Remember to save the changes.

![Service setting, adjusting base boarding time](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972932467/e0e1d1d8ab6a9e7fbd183692/elKOkU7MB358AOYQoR_ilDbDVAmaEkB6vQ.png?expires=1753820100&signature=2cf9daa537f05730ad9b4e131ad08b18f66017f57f5c2b012907a638b5575c6f&req=fSclH8p8mYdYFb4f3HP0gEHDEwsH7UH%2FMnGegJ5p0q3OqJZVEOUvow05Xn7l%0AFz0%3D%0A)

## **Service Settings: Flexibilities**Adjusting the post-match and detour constraints can help fit more trips. However, this can also impact the riders’ experience, so 

Spare recommends adjusting the numbers gradually.

Here are the flexibilities that can be adjusted:

**Leave-At Forwards Flexibility **(Once a rider's request is confirmed, their pickup time may be moved later by X minutes.)

**Leave-At Backwards Flexibility** (Once a rider's request is confirmed, their pickup time may be moved earlier by X minutes.)

**Arrive-By Backwards Flexibility** (Once a rider's request is confirmed, their arrive-by dropoff time may be moved earlier by X minutes.)

**Detour Flexibility **(Configuration for the maximum allowed in-trip detour. A higher flexibility will lead to longer trip durations and a higher rate of pooling).

You can also adjust the parameters in the Optimization Insights Simulator first.

![Service setting, adjusting Detour Flexibility Level](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972932472/f1cd520933ffd46b3e675342/0xYRkasqQ7KQmUcRj_RY2kVbthTMYf4OzA.png?expires=1753820100&signature=6308a83b8597a8b1b51cc56f862157c654a43728e5be8950ac232c101bf00f84&req=fSclH8p8mYZdFb4f3HP0gEsqFloLVeI8UYKxFyjxC6CdCLHwt%2BQp4%2FQgkgqm%0AQRo%3D%0A)

## **Zone Settings: Time Rules**Time 

Rules tell your riders they can book their trip during a specific time frame (e.g., 6 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.).

Consider increasing/decreasing service hours according to the demand. 

For example, you can increase the service hours during summer, when more people travel to more places. On the contrary, you can reduce service hours during the low seasons. The last one can save operational costs, e.g., by reducing the service time frame by 2 hours, you can save up to 365 hours for 6 months.

To access time rules, go to the Service Planning tab and select Time rules. From there, click on the time rule name and enter the editor mode.

![Spare Launch. Time Rules page.](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972932477/a9431f7d0b19b9bd1abe12d4/-bMFhf0XYvrgYFqQMsSBzDtTGrgGaycK6A.png?expires=1753820100&signature=5c070694b47b620fc5f17eecb4a197fd92168242453db6033be0d5347a18145d&req=fSclH8p8mYZYFb4f3HP0gE%2BvD6g9afrTBEuArQOCoYhynMq94ZV1EeKSjtvO%0A1fk%3D%0A)

## **Zone Settings: Stops**

- Depending on the zone type you currently have, consider the following changes to increase service efficiency:

Shift from the **Door-to-Door **type to the **Closest Stops**. This will reduce pickup, dropoff, and pooling times, allowing more people to be picked up/dropped off in one location, and the drivers can save time by avoiding going an extra block or making a U-turn to get to the destination.

Shift from the **Closest Stops** to the **Optimized Stops**. In this case, the Engine will analyze the closest stops around the rider, consider the walking distance and driving costs, and attempt to create an optimal pickup/dropoff location. 

To configure the settings, go to the Service Planning tab, and select the service you’d like to edit.

![Spare Launch Service Planning](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972932484/7d8e5e0655d4d1970a1c7417/wc_mH0WGIKwq127SfnabolPniAgXKJq7PQ.png?expires=1753820100&signature=e9066dd3e79102a51936bde889aac7a70488c0736e3fcb37894f5b7cb6e19b09&req=fSclH8p8mYlbFb4f3HP0gHYYTW0CC%2F0j53QhsBB%2FN%2Bb3OemrF4NJL9dEcqda%0A5xM%3D%0A)

From there, open the Zones tab and click on the Zone name.

![Spare Launch Screenshot. Service Settings. Zone settings](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972932488/7e3955ffc4713daeec2f2fa2/wHwiggRYaqmFb2ahIdOD48pGDeU_k2YPeQ.png?expires=1753820100&signature=21f222a7a962bf3a42366dfd99aaf405c5f20715d9fa3125d860ff93c1a446dd&req=fSclH8p8mYlXFb4f3HP0gCAz5mKIUb1ynX1P4zqF8GBjJfDnu0VM4oL8RVJC%0AVE8%3D%0A)

In the Zone settings, open the Zone Type dropdown menu and select the desired option.

![Spare Launch. Service Settings. Zone Type dropdown.](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972932492/495beb5db1e7836c38f7ddbe/DQ80azAWSmKAg03Kqri2eWafrJPeRQxytQ.png?expires=1753820100&signature=87af371b3c072693992d26eff54a62099e9a382c2598ac18670d893625e216fb&req=fSclH8p8mYhdFb4f3HP0gCea3I4%2BUoBz884GOqwVW9X%2BYgxyWAOqy%2F9jtS6i%0AkgQ%3D%0A)

Remember to save the changes before leaving the page.

## **Fleet Settings: Fleet Sliders**Fleet Sliders allow you to add some flexibility in a way that the Engine decides how requests are distributed between the duties, and in what order. 

However:

Dragging the slider way too much to the “Driving Time” means more pooling, but can potentially increase the number of idle vehicles.

Dragging the slider towards “Wait Time” means more pooling and better OTP, but can potentially create more detours.

Spare’s Recommendation: Spare advises you to keep the slides in the middle or slightly move them in the required directions, but not more than 2/3 of the line.

To access fleet sliders, go to the Fleet settings (Service Planning -> Fleets -> Selected Fleet -> Edit Fleet)

![Fleets slides set to the default positions](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972932497/5ae983df08f89fd6baf58350/_xWVkA68T75RKYD06_UqEO_5jhc771QZcQ.png?expires=1753820100&signature=ca183ee5da7e531aac1a5f3c49aad80a9689e467f6f9040cab3feaca59399667&req=fSclH8p8mYhYFb4f3HP0gPSoMrAAtVPCFfB09F4J%2FWKWrp0VQtJEesM3ujKm%0AcUI%3D%0A)

## **Fleet Settings: Duty Time & Start/End Locations**

- Once your service is launched, here are a couple of things to consider when scheduling the duties:

**Duty Time:** make sure that your service peak times are covered. Consider reducing the duty time during off-peak periods.

**Duty Start/End locations: **make sure they’re conveniently located within the zone and the driver doesn’t have to travel too many extra miles.

You can adjust the settings in the Shift Scheduling tab when creating/editing a duty.

## **Fleet Settings: Static Driver Breaks & Dynamic Driver Breaks**Consider switching from **Static Driver Breaks **(when breaks have a static schedule based on the configured break policy and cannot be moved around to accommodate additional trips) to **Dynamic Driver** 

Breaks (breaks are flexible, but their number and duration are unchanged).

Read more about Automatic Driver Breaks here:

[Driver Breaks](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8967492-setting-up-automated-driver-breaks)Reach out to your Partner Success Manager and discuss the possible change. The dynamic breaks will then be enabled for your service.
