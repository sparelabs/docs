**Booking Cutoff Time** is an expanded version of the existing** ‘Minimum Advance Booking Time’** functionality. The Booking Cutoff Time feature was introduced to allow a **static and dynamic cutoff time** to be set, ensuring rides are booked with enough time to be fulfilled.

It also instructs the user on their further steps (e.g., "Book by 5:30 PM the day before the trip") for their request to be placed successfully.

## How to set up the Booking Cutoff TimeFrom **Spare Operations**, go to **Service Planning** and select **Services**.  Go to the **Service 

Settings**.

Scroll down to the **Minimum Advance Booking Time **and choose one of the 3 options:

**No Cutoff **(There are no cutoffs, and riders can book trips anytime);

**Cutoff Based on Trip Time **(There is a cutoff when a rider can book no more than X minutes/hours in advance)

**Cutoff at a Set Time** (There is a static time to cut off a booking window the day before a trip, e.g., at 5:30 PM)

## What it looks like from the Rider's Side

If the rider tries to book a trip on this service after the cutoff time, they will see the service-disabled and how far in advance they need to book for this service.

## Setting the start of your "Service Day"Your service may operate until 3am, and so you'll need to specify this in Spare Operations so we ensure that rides aren't booked between 12am-3am when they shouldn't be. You can do this in Settings -> General -> Organization with the "Service Day Start 

Time":

However, if you change this setting to 3am (or another time) then riders will not be able to book these "same day trips".

## Where else is the Service Day Start Time used?At the moment, the Service Day Start Time is just used to control the Booking Cutoff Time. It does not impact pages like Shift Scheduling or 

Reporting, although this is coming in the future.
