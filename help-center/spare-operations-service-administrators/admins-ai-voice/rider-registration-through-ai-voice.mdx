## About this feature

AI Voice Rider Registration allows new riders to set up their profiles directly through the AI agent. 

New riders no longer need to wait for a human booking agent to set up their account, streamlining the onboarding process and allowing riders to sign up at any hour of the day.

## Enabling AI Voice Rider Registration

Navigate to **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Agents** and click to view your AI Voice agent.

Click **Edit Agent**.

- Under **Agent Capabilities**, toggle **Rider Registration** to on.

## How it works

**Unrecognized Caller**: When the caller's number isn't associated with an existing rider profile, the AI will ask the caller whether they want to create an account or transfer to a human.

If the rider has an existing account with a different phone number, they can transfer to a human operator to reconcile the difference between numbers.

**First Name and Last Name**: If the caller chooses to create an account, the caller will be asked to provide their name. The AI agent will read back the spelling of the name to ensure accuracy. 

If your agency only requires a name and phone number for riders to use your service, then the rider's profile will be created at this point!

**Remaining Required Fields**: If your agency requires specific custom fields, the AI will guide the rider through populating each field, ensuring all required information is captured.

**Success**: Once the profile is created, the caller will be able to book new trips.

## FAQ

**What if riders also try to register via the app?**

If a rider who registered by phone call downloads the rider app and attempts to register that way, the app will recognize their phone number and log them in without creating a duplicate rider account.

**Are riders required to use the AI interface to register?**

No, riders who prefer not to use the AI interface can opt to transfer to a human agent at any point in the call.

**What happens if my agency has specific custom fields for registration?**

The AI will guide the rider through any required fields, ensuring a complete registration aligned with your agency's requirements.
