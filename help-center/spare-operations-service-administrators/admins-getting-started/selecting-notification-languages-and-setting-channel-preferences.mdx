## What are Notification Language and Channel Preferences?

A combination of notification settings & configurations when sending a message that helps agencies communicate more effectively with riders. This feature enables you to reach riders using their preferred method (either phone call, SMS, app notification, or email) and in their preferred language (set from a list that the agency approves).

## What is the value?

Everybody has their habits with technology, and this means notification preferences are not a one-size-fits-all. If Spare’s customers are going to reach the greatest number of riders, they need to reach riders in a manner they’re used to. 

This feature places that choice with the rider and makes it more likely for a message to reach them.

## What does it look like for customers/users?## Setting the languages your agency supports

Head to Settings → Organization and then scroll down

These messages will automatically be delivered to the rider’s preferred channel. Select a fallback channel in case the rider has nothing selected.

Then, craft the message in each language that your organization supports.

You can also adjust the message for each channel. If nothing is filled in here, it will default to whatever is filled in above.

This same functionality is used across the platform when a message is sent, notably in “Event Notifications” to keep riders informed of their trip updates.

## 

## **Creating event notifications in multiple languages**Head to Spare Operations → Rider Communication → Event Notifications and click “Add Event 

Notification”

Back in the 1st step, you’ve already set the languages your organization supports. Now, those languages will show as options on this page. Create the event notification that you’d like and fill in the message in all of your supported languages.

Scrolling down, you’ll see that this notification will be sent to the rider’s preference. If the rider hasn’t set one, you’ll need to select the secondary channel as a fallback:

## How can I use this feature?This feature is a part of Spare's Notifications Pro package. Speak to your Spare representative to enable it. 

Turning this on will enable you to set specific languages the organization supports, choose preferred languages for riders, and preferred communications channels.

It’s important to note that when turning on this feature flag, this will mean each event notification will only send to **one **channel, the rider’s choice or the secondary channel. Some organizations in the past have used our Event Notifications to send the same message to multiple channels at once. This is no longer possible with this feature turned on.

Channel and language preferences are not currently available for announcements, as these are always sent in-app anyways.
