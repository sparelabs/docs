Bringing awareness around a new service you're launching is crucial. It helps your riders get informed, excited, and ready to try something they may not have been familiar with before.

Here's what we recommend the information page should include:

## **Example Rider App Trip Booking 

Instructions**

"Booking a trip is easy, just follow these steps:

Download the [branded] rider app from either app store

Google Play Store link

Apple App Store link

Open the [branded] rider app on your mobile device.

Tap on the “Where to?” box and select your drop-off location by searching for a point of interest or address. When selecting your pickup spot you can use your current location (the default) or enter your pickup location/address manually.

Add additional passengers or request accessibility features by tapping on the “Passenger” or “Wheelchair” icons.

If you want to schedule your trip in advance, select a later time by tapping “Schedule” in the lower right corner. 

Add in advanced booking information here, like “trips can be booked up to two days in advance” - or whatever the service configuration is. 

Choose to add a credit card and pay for your trip in the app or select cash and pay on the vehicle.

Review your estimated pickup and drop-off time and tap “Request Ride” when ready.

Once a trip is created, riders will receive real-time updates via text or app notifications and can track vehicle location and estimated arrival time in the [branded] app. In addition, helpful information about the vehicle will be available including the make, color, and license plate."
