Within the Spare Platform, you will be granted two Organizations: **Testing** and **Production**.

## The Testing OrganizationThe Testing Organization is designed for exactly that:** testing the ins and outs of your service**. 

This is where you can create your service area, and zones, add fleets, drivers, riders, duties, time rules, announcements, etc.

We encourage you to take time using the Testing Org and get familiar with how everything works before moving anything into the Production Organization.

**The Testing Org will emulate what you want your Production Org** to look and operate like and is a chance for you to make sure everything is in order before launch. The Testing Org is also useful if you want to try out something before putting it into Production. Think of it as a place for trial and error, a chance to test out systems, and tailor operations to best fit your service.

## The Production OrganizationThe Production 

Organization is the place **where your service will live and operate.**

- Changes made here will immediately affect your service, riders, and drivers in the real world (if your service is enabled). Because of this, we recommend you are 100% sure of the change(s) or additions you would like to make (by trying them out in the Testing Organization first).

Once you are happy with the setup you have in your Testing Organization, you can bring this information into your Production Organization.
