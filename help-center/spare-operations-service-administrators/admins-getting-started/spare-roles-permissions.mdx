description: "Comprehensive overview of Spare's default roles and associated permissions for managing user access across your organization"
---

Spare provides a comprehensive set of default roles that serve as the foundation for managing user permissions across your organization. These predefined roles are designed to streamline access control by grouping common permissions together, making it easier to assign appropriate access levels to different users.

## Role Implementation

To implement these roles effectively, you'll apply them to user groups as access grants. This approach allows you to control what users can see and do within the system based on their responsibilities and requirements. 

Additionally, Spare supports role layering, which means you can apply multiple roles to a single user group simultaneously. This flexibility enables you to create custom permission combinations that precisely match your organizational needs without having to create entirely new roles from scratch.

## Role Assignment Best Practices

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege

Assign users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their job functions effectively.

### 2. Role Layering Strategy

- Start with a base role that provides core functionality
- Add specialized roles for specific features or modules
- Review and adjust permissions regularly based on actual usage

### 3. Regular Permission Audits

- Conduct periodic reviews of user permissions
- Remove unnecessary access when roles change
- Document permission changes for compliance

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Identify User Requirements

- Map out job functions and responsibilities
- Determine which systems and features each role needs
- Consider workflow dependencies and collaboration needs

### Step 2: Select Base Roles

Choose appropriate default roles that closely match user requirements:

- **Operations staff**: Start with Operations Manager or Operations Assistant
- **Customer service**: Use Booking Agent or Booking Agent Assistant
- **Planning teams**: Consider Service Planner or Scheduler roles
- **Technical users**: Platform User or App Developer roles

### Step 3: Apply Role Layering

Add specialized access roles as needed:

- Add Analytics access for reporting needs
- Include Eligibility access for paratransit operations
- Apply Realize access for planning functions

### Step 4: Test and Validate

- Create test user accounts with assigned roles
- Verify access to required functions
- Ensure restricted access works as expected
- Gather feedback from actual users

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

<Warning>
- Never assign more permissions than necessary
- Regularly review and update role assignments
- Monitor for unusual access patterns or usage
</Warning>

### Compliance

<Note>
- Document all role assignments and changes
- Maintain audit trails for permission modifications
- Ensure role assignments comply with organizational policies
</Note>
