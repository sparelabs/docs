## **What are Digital Farepass Links?**Many agencies use app-based ticketing services. Examples include Masabi, Pronto, Token Transit, Cubic & Bytemark. Agencies predominantly use them for fixed-route services. Riders can use single-use tickets, and daily or monthly passes on their app. The passes are then validated when they board the vehicle. The validation can either be done by the driver, QR or NF

C scanner on the vehicle.,

The digital fare pass deep link enables users who book rides in Spare to specify theyâ€™re going to pay with a 3rd party (e.g. Token Transit) when they board the vehicle. To make it easy for the rider to pay, we display a deep link in the Rider app that opens the third party app when pressed.

## **What is the value?**For transit agencies, this deep link enables them to unify payment methods across demand response and fixed route services, promoting multi-modal journeys and increasing the number of riders on each service. 

A single daily pass can be used for both modes!

## **What does it look like for customers/users?**This integrations allows administrators to set the third party as a method to accept. Riders can select and purchase tickets when booking a ride and get reminded to get their pass ready before boarding. Riders can also select default payment in settings. 

When getting matched with a ride, the payment method will be shown in the accepted screen.
