At Spare, we understand the importance of providing exceptional experiences for riders. That's why we're excited to share a step-by-step workflow that allows you to offer free fare days. In this article, we'll guide you through the process, ensuring that your customers can enjoy the benefits of a free day.

**Create a New Service**
​
To begin, you'll need to create a new service specifically for the free fare day. This ensures that the free service is distinct and can't be booked in advance. While duplicating an existing service isn't possible, don't worry, our dedicated support team is ready to assist you.
​
To set up a new service, follow the steps from the article below:

**Set Service Parameters**
​
In this step, you'll configure the settings for the new service. This includes defining zones, flexibilities, accessibility features, and any other relevant parameters. Make sure to tailor these settings to match the requirements of the free fare day.

**Configure Time Rules and Fares **
Now, it's time to set the time rules and fares for the free day service. Determine the start and end date for the day when the fares will be free. By specifying these details, you ensure that customers only encounter the free service on that particular day.

**Create an Exception Date for Existing Service**
Instead of disabling the existing service, add an exception day to its time rules. This exception day will exclude the free day from the regular pricing structure. This approach allows customers to make advance bookings at the full price while still benefiting from the free fare day.

**Disable the Free Day Service **
Once the free day is over, there's no need to delete the newly created service. Simply disable it to prevent further bookings. This way, your regular service resumes seamlessly after the free fare day.
