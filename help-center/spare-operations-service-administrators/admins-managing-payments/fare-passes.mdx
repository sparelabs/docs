Fare Passes can be set up for riders to purchase and apply to their account. 

## How to Create a Fare Pass

Fare Passes can be found under **Spare Pay** on the left-hand navigation menu. Once selected, the option to **+ Add Fare Pass** is displayed in the top right-hand corner.

The Fare Pass will remain in a draft format until **Publish Fare Pass** is then selected.

Once published the Fare Pass will be visible in the rider app for riders to purchase and add to their account.

## Types of Fare Passes

Fare Passes can be **time-based, calendar-based or value-based** and are typically set up to offer the rider a way to mass purchase rider tickets, often incentivized with a discount.

## Limitations

- [Stripe](/help-center/spare-operations-service-administrators/admins-managing-payments/spare-pay-for-stripe) must be enabled in order to take payment details

- Fare Passes can't be restricted to a particular service

## FAQ

**Who can apply fare passes from the admin panel?**

Anyone with allocation management permissions. So this would be:

- Root Admins
- Admins
- Financial Manager

**Is the start of the monthly pass at the start of the month, or after the expiry time?**

The start time of a monthly pass will always be the beginning of the month. This means that if a user has consecutive monthly passes and the expiry time was, say 6 am, between the beginning of the month 12 AM - 6 AM the user will have 2 active passes.

**Will users be charged in a bulk application of fare passes?**

No. Charges will **NOT** be made in bulk applications.
