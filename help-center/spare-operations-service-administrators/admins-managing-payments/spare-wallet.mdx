## What is the Wallet?This is a new payment method in the Spare Platform that allows your riders to load and store funds in a configurable wallet. Riders can then use these funds to pay for their trips seamlessly, choosing the wallet as their preferred payment method during the booking process. 

This feature provides greater flexibility and control over payments, enhancing the overall rider experience by simplifying transactions and avoiding the need for physical payment methods or credit/debit cards for each ride.

## Can I remove funds from a rider's wallet?This is not currently possible from the rider's profile page, but you can accomplish this by importing a negative number. 

This will error if you try to import a large enough negative number that the rider's balance would be less than 0.

For example, if the rider's current balance is $10.00

And you attempt to import an additionalBalance of -$11.00

This will cause an error

You can see an example of reducing two wallets, once by -$5.00 and one by -$10.00:

Wallet? **

- No, if you attempt to book a trip for $5 but only have $2 in your Spare Wallet, this will not work. 

**How does the Spare Wallet differ from [Stored Value Fare Passes](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8993996-creating-and-editing-fare-passes)?**

- The Stored Value Fare Pass is another method of providing a way for riders to pay for their rides in Spare. There are some limitations that the Stored Value Fare Pass has, which Spare Wallet addresses, including: 

If a rider has a Stored Value Fare Pass, they can't choose whether to use it or not. The Spare Wallet can be chosen, alongside other payment methods enabled on that service. 

If the rider has $10 in their Stored Value Fare Pass, and the ride is $5, the ride would appear as "Free", without an indication that the Fare Pass is being used. 

Most importantly, a Stored Value Fare Pass is one-use. You cannot reload it with funds, you have to create another one. This can be hard to keep track of if a rider always wants to add small amounts. 

**Is there a maximum limit to what can be stored on an individual Spare Wallet? **
Yes, it's around $10,000 USD. Each organization's Wallet can be configured to have their own maximum, but it must not exceed this global max.

**What roles can access the Wallet? **

- Booking agents, Financial managers, Operational Managers, and Administrators  are able to create / edit any wallet for any rider, including adding funds to their wallets. As for actually editing the wallet configuration (the wallet payment method type - setting the balance limit, etc) this is only available to administrators.
