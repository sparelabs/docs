# How we manage Payments in Spare? We allow agencies to customize the payment methods each service can accept. Agencies can now create custom in-vehicle payment methods, like “Ticket” or “Monthly Pass”. We call these Payment Method Types. 

**Customizable for Agencies**: Transit organizations can now align the payment options in the app with their specific ticketing requirements.

**Simplify Payments for Riders:** Riders can now clearly see the payment methods that are available to them. Previously the only in-vehicle payment option that Spare supported was ‘Cash’.

**Increase Ridership**: By standardizing payment methods across fixed routes and demand response services, transit organizations can attract a broader customer base.

**Improve Reporting and Visibility**: Agencies gain clearer insights into payment trends and preferences, helping in better decision-making and service improvement.p

**Digital Integration**: For an additional fee, Spare can now support digital payment platforms like Token Transit, ensuring a smooth transition for riders using mobile ticketing services. More info on that here: [Digital Farepass Links (e.g. Token Transit)](https://www.notion.so/Digital-Farepass-Links-e-g-Token-Transit-a3eff4ef32624dd9a24c0d059d2e7fc5?pvs=21)

**Streamlines** **Workflows: **In most cases, payments are processed on the rider’s side and don’t require a Booking Agent’s involvement. However, you can still view fare information, apply promo codes, and help the rider set up their IVR Payment (if applicable).

# Customizing Payment MethodsUnder the "Payment Methods" section, you can add new ones or edit the default options like "Cash" or "Stripe".

- Go to the **Rides tab [1]** and select **Requests[2]**. Click **+** **Add Requests [3]**. Fill in the trip-related information.

**2. Add Payment Method**

- Click on **"Add Payment Method"** and** "Add Credit Card by phone"** to send an IVR phone call to the rider. You may want to give the rider a heads-up that he/she is receiving a call from us and ask whether they want to hang up your call or put you on hold.

![](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/971484578/92b2fef935246a3c3d0403ee/3QHEATUsQUpBocrh9mEY8kAEFUN8FZlmVQ.png?expires=1753820100&signature=87d722969bbb4c7a76e6dcb9abefcd582a89968a654faba1986272c5edf89c34&req=fScmEsF6mIZXFb4f3HP0gM5z8M8OGVVShP%2Bh9%2FxDwhEXuGLJSvMJdrCeNiu9%0Ay%2BE%3D%0A)

**3. Rider to Input Credit Card Information**

- As soon as sending an IVR call to the rider, the rider receives a phone call and can input credit card information through the phone call. It will ask for credit card numbers, expiry dates, postal codes (only for US riders), and CVC.

![](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/971484582/aa52fd1c89da7386e47ab110/b-HlrKshDP62Wu9KD7zJpmCUFbhGSBScVg.png?expires=1753820100&signature=18fba8baf5e7512fb6314924425dca985423d7ba3c884b14585437e5c057dd8b&req=fScmEsF6mIldFb4f3HP0gO38s2gV%2FjYBauCOhCrSt%2BDsBifcqwgIfg9JubBE%0AMNw%3D%0A)

| You can see the process of the input on the platform and once done, the rider's credit card information will appear as a payment method. Whenever you book a trip for this rider, the credit card will be there as a payment method. | # **Assisting Riders via Stripe**If a rider experiences difficulties with setting up their preferred payment method in the app, you can assist them by either triggering an IVR call (see instructions in the previous section) or manually processing their payment in Stripe. |
​
To assist customers in Stripe, make sure you have the required permissions and log in to your Stripe account. From there, select the Customers tab and identify the rider profile you'd like to make edits to. Then, from their profile overview page, scroll down to Payment Methods and click Add. Fill in the card information and click "Add Card" to save the changes.

**Please note that Stripe won't accept a payment of less than $0.50.**

- Spare Operations offers a "Payment Methods" tab to add custom payment methods and edit existing ones like "Cash" and "Stripe". 

# What are the current limitations?It is not possible to set an in-vehicle payment method as a default payment method. The default payment methods are either Cash or Stripe Cards.

| The text “Cash” in the rider and driver app will no longer be translated automatically. Currently, it is not possible to update cash to something else. In the near future, we’re releasing the option to rename cash in the Payment method settings. | ![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1039965113/fb4fc10e0182db525b3790bc/image.png?expires=1753820100&signature=0c11e8e11e42e1256fedd7218a2be1836d54a337745cd4b8a65e49a0538c19b0&req=dSAkH8B4mIBeWvMW1HO4zbU5UtSsbSTfS4QW7R%2Bx1zskMHYYO2Q7JTKeOheJ%0AP6al%0A) |
