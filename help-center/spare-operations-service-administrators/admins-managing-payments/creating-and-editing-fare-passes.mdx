Fare Passes can be set up for riders to purchase and apply to their account.

Fare Passes can be **time-based** or **value-based **and are typically set up to offer the rider a way to mass purchase rider tickets, often incentivized with a discount.

## How to Create a Fare PassFare Passes can be found under** "Spare Pay" **on the left-hand navigation menu. Once selected, the option to "**+ Add Fare 

Pass"** is displayed in the top right-hand corner.

From here, all the details can be filled in and the type can be selected, either time-based or stored value. Select **"Create New Fare Pass"** once complete.

The Fare Pass will remain in a draft format until "**Publish Fare Pass"** is then selected.

Once published the Fare Pass will be visible in the rider app for riders to purchase and add to their account. 

The rider can select a pass to purchase and their card details, if not already on file, are requested.

Once purchased the rider will be able to use the Fare Pass on all upcoming trips until the expiry date (if time-based) or the credit has run out (value-based). It is also possible to archive the Fare Pass from the admin panel if necessary.

**Important things to note:**

[Stripe](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/wyxobwoi/articles/articles/8989425/show) must be enabled to take payment details

The Fare Pass begins once enabled, there is no start date

Only the rider can add themselves to a Fare Pass via the Rider App

Fare Passes can't be restricted to a particular service

## How to test Fare Pass Settings (Rider side)

The way riders see payment instructions on their end depends on the type of fare pass:

If it’s a ‘time-based’ fare pass (e.g., 30 days), then it just shows the trip as ‘free’ when you book the ride;

If it’s a ‘stored value’ fare pass (e.g., $50) and the value on the pass is greater than the fare, it shows as free. If the value of the pass is less than the fare, it shows a discounted fare.

To test this, you can use a [Stripe Test Credit Card](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).
