Let’s say your service is impacted by severe weather or a road closure or you have scheduled maintenance and you need to let your riders know. Bulk Messaging allows transit organizations to create a message and broadcast it to the relevant riders, at the right time.

Bulk Messages allow for more direct and relevant communication to your riders, when they need it. This not only increases the transparency of your services but improves the rider experience by being able to get this information to riders as direct and quickly as possible.

**Real-Time or Scheduled Updates:** Send your riders urgent updates keeping them informed on service changes or weather warnings. Alternatively choose to scheduled a message for a future date and time e.g. service disruptions or special offers

**Target the right Riders:** Optimize engagement by targeting your message to riders:

By Group: Choose one or multiple groups to send to.

With a Past Trip: Send to riders who have travelled in a specified date range. Additionally filter this to specific services.

With a Scheduled Trip: Send to riders who have a scheduled trip within a specified date range. Additionally filter this to specific services.

Custom: Upload a .csv file to send a bulk message to a custom group of riders.

**Rider Channel Preference:** Riders can now set the channel they prefer communication through so sending important updates are more likely to get to your riders successfully.

**Multiple Language Support:** Riders can now set their preferred language so when sending a message, admins can configure messages for all supported languages.

**Channel Formatting**: You can format each channel to have a customized messaged that best suits that delivery.
