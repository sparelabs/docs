In some cases, you may need to stop a rider from using your services. In this event, we have a feature called **"Rider Suspensions"**.

This feature will allow an Administrator or Operations Manager to suspend a rider's profile for however long they choose. Once a rider is suspended, they will not be able to book trips on any of your services.

If the rider attempts to book a trip, they will see an in-app message explaining the situation.

## How to Suspend Riders

> **Note:** Rider Suspensions are an optional feature. Please reach out to your Spare representative if you would like Suspensions enabled for your organization.

There are two ways you can apply suspensions:

### From the Rider Profile

1. Log into the Spare Platform. Then select **Users** → **Riders** to get to the Rider list. Once here, search for and select the rider in question.

![Users menu navigation to Riders section](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972665231/3a56029200156f61bde0182f/6RKOQeLLrzWHX6pMEQwI7NWhAzXigkeutA.png?expires=1753820100&signature=464ea18b2dd99f5cab2412ba79d7b8062d94a15a59292e9a792acff2e11ff826&req=fSclEM97n4JeFb4f3HP0gPUEmcbkNsnkFxq2Wu8zs6cepH34%2Bliv303uSBvC%0ADec%3D%0A)

2. Once you have selected the rider, you will be brought to the rider's profile. You must then scroll to the bottom until you can see the section titled **"Rider Suspensions"**. Then select the **"Add Rider Suspension"** button.

![Rider Suspensions section with Add Rider Suspension button](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972665232/006833fe8a125a0b2a267bca/YqlAdf_Wgwvf3VcbAAdTPMx_Gnc2ek4xpA.png?expires=1753820100&signature=9efd36290e9aa2d65604044ffbaef3a3b68b405af3ef4cc41f47a40ad6b05006&req=fSclEM97n4JdFb4f3HP0gAzXqLF%2FEMBGVvUtSoIINl8D8j2K9vbvzxhw6enD%0AuwQ%3D%0A)

3. On this page, you can fill in a field for "Reason for suspension" and use the "Suspension enforced until" option to choose the end date of the rider's suspension.

4. You can also add a start day of the suspension. By default, it's set as "Today". Uncheck the box if you want to select another start date from the calendar.

![Suspension configuration form with reason and date fields](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972665233/348a272aa913260f51b6a2b8/956-pIzLzyDFh8p0oTi531yZJSZe0Yf6lg.png?expires=1753820100&signature=49c03313b76575f24f05aacd36ae268615bf33aa8ff46f11495e7b58ff0c273d&req=fSclEM97n4JcFb4f3HP0gE58x%2BvTrW5VLHKIqQv7cIzM9VXTPUjP1M%2FrTW4f%0Am94%3D%0A)

5. Once you have added the necessary information, select **"Create New Suspension"** to finish the process.

> **Important:** Any trips the suspended rider has scheduled during the suspension period will be automatically cancelled by the suspension.

If you would ever like to end a rider's suspension before it is set to expire, the **"End Suspension Early"** option will reactivate the rider's account immediately. This will not automatically reschedule trips that were cancelled by the suspension.

## View Existing Rider Suspensions

Suspensions are accessible at any time from either:

**The "Suspensions" section of the rider's profile:**

**Or the "Suspensions" tab (Users → Suspensions):**

![Global Suspensions tab showing all active and past suspensions](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/972665263/013011155d21d7b8da33878d/-yvv68KfkPk7LlH6EnSzvpy0rrQzU3KH8A.png?expires=1753820100&signature=d270ade6c4132b7a4421d4045121f847299d1c6eccb01ebd5e53f7bce9f83ddf&req=fSclEM97n4dcFb4f3HP0gMf2Fz6FZoWB9fbInD6K04Kp3QhRp%2FDNpZqWmyhs%0ACbA%3D%0A)

## Phone Number Suspensions

It is also possible to suspend a rider's phone number. This is useful in circumstances where the rider deletes and re-creates an account to circumvent the suspension. The process is identical to Rider Suspensions, but using the Phone Number Suspensions section beneath it:
