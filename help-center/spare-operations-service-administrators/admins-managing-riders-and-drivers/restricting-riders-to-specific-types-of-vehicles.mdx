Sometimes riders are unable to ride in a certain type of vehicle. For example, the rider may be ambulatory but unable to travel in a vehicle that requires the use of steps to board. To help you in these situations, we've built Rider to Vehicle Type restrictions. Here's how it works:

## Editing a Rider's Allowed Vehicle Types

A rider's allowed vehicle types can be edited from the rider profile. In the Overview tab you will see an area called 'Allowed Vehicle Types'.

By default, riders can use all vehicle types. To change this, press **Edit Allowed Vehicle Types**. In the menu that opens, you can select the allowed vehicle types and add a reason for the restriction.

Once you've made your changes, hit **Save** to enforce the restriction.

## Important Considerations

> Modifications to Allowed Vehicle Types only apply to newly created requests. If the rider has an existing request, you'll need to Edit & Rematch all existing requests for the modification to apply.

> In addition, all Vehicles in your Organization need to be mapped to Vehicle Types in order for this functionality to work reliably.

## Warning: Interaction with Accessibility Features

> **Warning:** Allowed Vehicle Types work in conjunction with Accessibility Feature Restrictions. Let's walk through a practical example. An agency has Wheelchair accessible Vans and sedans for ambulatory passengers. John is restricted from riding in Vans, but a booking agent creates a request for John with 1 wheelchair on it. It is not possible for Spare's Engine to match the request to a vehicle, as the only wheelchair-accessible vehicle is a van, and John is restricted from riding in vans. In this scenario, the request will remain in 'Processing' and go to 'No Drivers Available'.
