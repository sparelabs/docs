Before saving your announcement, **decide if you want it to be geofenced**. Geofencing allows you to restrict your announcement to a specific geographic area. Only users located within the geofence boundaries will receive the announcement in their rider app.

To create a geofence, click **Add Geofence** at the top of the announcement window.

**Draw your geofence** on the map by clicking points and drawing lines to other points until the zone is entirely enclosed. You can use the blue bar at the bottom to undo, redo, dispose of your zone, or import a zone shapefile. Once you have drawn your geofence zone and named it, click on the back arrow - the geofence will now be active for this announcement.

To save your announcement, click **Save Announcement **at the bottom of the window. You should now see a list of all of your announcements in the Announcements menu. 

To edit an announcement, click on it, click **Edit Announcement** at the top of the window, and then follow the same process as above.

Remember that your announcement is** only active once you have enabled it **in its settings.

Once enabled, announcements **will appear at the top of the rider app** (if using the Spare Rider app) as in the image below.

A user can then** tap on the announcements button to see more information**.
