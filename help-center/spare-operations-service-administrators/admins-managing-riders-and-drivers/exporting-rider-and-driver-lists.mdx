2. Click **Riders** (or **Drivers**). Once the page with all of your riders or drivers is displayed, select **Export Riders** (or **Export Drivers**).

## Available Filters

You can choose to apply filters to this export such as:

- **Created At** - Filter by when the user account was created
- **Last Seen** - Filter by when the user was last active
- **Group** - Filter by specific user groups

> If you do not select any filters, all riders or drivers and their information will be exported.

## Export Format

Finally, select whether you would like the information exported in a **CSV or Excel file**. The file will then appear in the **Downloads folder on your computer** or at the bottom of the Chrome browser.
