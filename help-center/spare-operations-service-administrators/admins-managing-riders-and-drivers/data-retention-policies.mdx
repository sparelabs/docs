## What are Data Retention Policies?Data Retention Policies help your agency to flag data that can be removed from the Spare system. **By default, your data is kept in perpetuity, so it is retained forever. **

- If your agency has policies to remove certain data after a certain period of time, this feature enables you to track that. 

## How do I set up a Data Retention Policy?

First, head to your settings:

Different objects (like riders vs drivers) can have different policies. Then, select the Data Retention tab:

This report will show you all the individual riders, drivers, trips, etc that are past their data retention period. You can download this as a csv to review and determine if you'd actually like to remove this data.

## How do I actually delete the data?Given the security concerns around deleting data (and not being able to recover it at all), this action is not possible from the platform. Instead, once you've reviewed your Data Retention Report and identified the individual riders, drivers, trips, etc to delete, please get in touch with your Partner Success Manager to request deletion. 

Providing a copy of the report with the items you want to delete is the only information we require. 

Please expect a turnaround time of one month in order to properly and safely delete this data from the Spare Platform.
