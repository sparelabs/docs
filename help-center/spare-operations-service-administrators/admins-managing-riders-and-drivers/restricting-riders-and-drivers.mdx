Some riders and drivers strongly dislike one another and shouldn’t ride together. This feature allows Spare's engine to automatically avoid pairing these riders and drivers together.

# FAQ:#### How do I edit a restriction once it's created? 

If the restriction reason needs to be updated you’ll need to delete the restriction and create a new one

#### What happens after I create a restriction?

The restriction will automatically be applied to all new trips created by the system, however, existing trips will not be updated. 

**How do restrictions work with Force Match?**

[Force Match](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8959245-override-flexibilities#h_549f695a9f) overrides rider & driver restrictions, so be careful when using Force Match with restricted riders.

#### How do restrictions work with[ Fleet Sharing](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8984472-fleet-sharing)?You can’t create restrictions across organizations. So if a driver is part of Org A and a rider is part of org 

B, you won’t be able to create a restriction between them
