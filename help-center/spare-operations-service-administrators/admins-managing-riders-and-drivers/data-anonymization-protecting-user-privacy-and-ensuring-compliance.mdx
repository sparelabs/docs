Under the Privacy Configuration settings, customers have the option to enable either 'Trip Anonymization' or 'User Anonymization.' These features ensure that historical data within the ridership reports is anonymized after 100 days.

By enabling these settings, organizations can comply with data retention policies, enhance privacy measures, and mitigate the risk of breaching regulations.

## How Trip Data Anonymization WorksWhen 

Anonymization is enabled for an organization, the following actions are taken on relevant data:

**For Trip Anonymization:**

**Requests **with pickup timestamps older than 100 days:

Pickup and dropoff coordinates are truncated to 3 decimal places.

Pickup and dropoff addresses are set to 'Anonymized Address.'

Associated RiderId is removed from the request.

**Slots **with scheduled timestamps older than 100 days:

Scheduled location coordinates are truncated to 3 decimal places.

The address is set to 'Anonymized Address.'

**Estimates** with requested pickup timestamps older than 100 days:

Requested and scheduled pickup and dropoff locations are truncated.

RiderId is removed from the estimate.

**For User Anonymization:**

- RiderID is anonymized when a user either hasn't logged in for the past 100 days or when they haven't booked a trip for this time.

It's important to note that the anonymization process is irreversible. Once the data has been anonymized, it cannot be restored to its original state.

It can also impact the accuracy of some user metrics for reporting.

## Why Enable Data Anonymization?**Compliance with Data Retention 

Policies:**

- Many agencies and organizations are subject to strict data retention policies that require the disposal of un-anonymized data after a certain period. By enabling Data Anonymization, organizations can adhere to these policies and mitigate the risk of breaching data retention regulations.

**GDPR Compliance:**

- The implementation of Data Anonymization was primarily motivated by the need to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Organizations operating in the European Union (EU) can leverage this feature to meet their obligations and safeguard user privacy.

**Enhanced Data Privacy:**

- Data Anonymization ensures that personally identifiable information is effectively protected. By anonymizing sensitive data, organizations can minimize the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and privacy violations.

If you'd like to enable the Data Anonymization feature for your organization, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager for more information.
