## OverviewEarly and Late Trip 

Notifications keep riders informed when their scheduled ride is running significantly earlier or later than expected. 

## How It 

Works## When You'll Receive Notifications

The system uses different rules for the first and subsequent notifications:

**First Notification (No Previous Delayed/Early Notifications):**

- Triggered when the ETA changes by **more than 7 minutes** from your original scheduled pickup time

**Early notifications**: Sent **10 minutes before** the new estimated pickup time (or immediately if less time remains)

**Late notifications**: Sent **10 minutes before** the original scheduled pickup time (or immediately if less time remains)

**Follow-up Notifications (After First Alert):**

- Triggered when the ETA changes by **more than 7 minutes** from the **last notified time**

- Sent **immediately** to keep you updated on significant changes

The system always compares to the most recent ETA you were notified about, not the original scheduled time

## Smart Notification Logic

The system is designed to be helpful, not annoying:

**7-minute threshold**: Both first and follow-up notifications require at least a 7-minute change to trigger

**Reference point changes**: After each notification, the system updates its reference point to the last notified ETA

**Cancelled notifications**: If the driver gets back on schedule before the notification is sent, it's automatically cancelled

**Immediate follow-ups**: Unlike first notifications (sent 10 min before arrival), follow-up notifications are sent immediately when detected
