## What is a Duty Delay?A duty delay is an event that pushes back the ETA of an upcoming trip on a driver’s manifest. This can be a vehicle breakdown, unexpected traffic, or a driver idling between stops. Spare records these events on the Duty 

Delays table.

## **Reviewing Duty Delays**To make reviewing duty delays, you can apply multiple filters. The two most common filters are Type and Minimum Delay. We recommend using a Minimum 

Delay of 10 minutes.

Clicking on any of the rows in your filtered view will bring you to the Duty Delay Details page. From here, you can review the specifics of the delay including using Duty Time Travel to review the duty's location and schedule before and after the delay. 

Note that Spare captures delays even in cases where service flexibilities result in trips being on time. As a result, the vehicle may appear green when reviewing it in Duty Time Travel, as in the example below.

While Spare has information about vehicle locations and schedules, there may be operational reasons for a delay that the table does not reflect. When investigating a delay, we recommend checking to see if there was any communication between the driver and the dispatch team. 

## **Understanding Types and Resolved Reasons**Once on the Duty Delays page, you’ll see different types of recorded delays. The first tool for understanding a delay is its 

Type:

**Unexpected Stops** – The vehicle remains stationary in an unplanned location for longer than a typical stoplight duration.

**Delayed Stop Completion** – The vehicle arrives at a stop but takes longer than expected to complete either the pickup or drop-off.

**Delayed Stop Departure** – The vehicle finishes a stop but does not leave immediately for the next pickup or drop-off.

**Slow Driving** – The vehicle is moving at a speed significantly lower than expected, based on Spare's suggested route and driving speed parameters.

Next, you can look at the Resolved Reason:

**Schedule Changed** – The Spare Engine or a dispatcher re-optimized manifests in response to the delay, mitigating lateness. 

**Vehicle Moved** – The vehicle resumed it's expected route following a delayed or unexpected stop.

**Slot Completed** – The next stop on the driver manifest was reached and completed. 

**Vehicle Idle** – For Slow Driving events, the vehicle came to a full stop. This can mean the Slow Driving delay ended and an Unexpected Stop delay began.

**Delay Resolved** – The delay has reduced to within a minute of the original time. As an example, a delay caused by a traffic jam resolved once the vehicle was past the jam.
