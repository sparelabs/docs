The Spare multimodal service has been enhanced to support additional transportation modes, providing riders with more comprehensive journey planning options.

## New Transportation Modes

### Bicycle Support

The multimodal service now includes **bicycle** as a supported mode of transport in journey leg responses. This enhancement allows for more comprehensive trip planning that incorporates cycling as part of multimodal journeys.

<Info>
Bicycle mode is automatically included in journey planning calculations where appropriate, based on distance, terrain, and available cycling infrastructure.
</Info>

### How Bicycle Mode Works

When planning multimodal journeys, the system now considers bicycle transportation for:
- **First/last mile connections**: Cycling to or from transit stops
- **Short-distance segments**: Direct cycling routes for shorter distances
- **Alternative routing**: Bicycle options when other modes are unavailable

### Journey Response Format

The multimodal API now returns bicycle as a possible journey leg mode:

```json
{
  "journeyLegs": [
    {
      "mode": "bicycle",
      "distance": 2.5,
      "duration": 12,
      "instructions": "Cycle north on Main Street for 2.5km"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

Bicycle mode is automatically enabled in the multimodal service and requires no additional configuration. The system intelligently determines when to include bicycle options based on:

- **Distance thresholds**: Appropriate cycling distances
- **Infrastructure availability**: Presence of bike lanes or cycling paths
- **Weather conditions**: Current and forecasted weather
- **User preferences**: Rider's transportation mode preferences

## API Integration

For developers integrating with the multimodal API, bicycle mode appears alongside other transportation modes in journey responses. No changes to existing API calls are required - the enhanced mode options are automatically included in responses where applicable.

            "route": "Line 1 Subway",
            "duration": 15
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Consider User Context">
    Bicycle options work best when users have indicated cycling as an acceptable mode or when other options are limited.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Weather Awareness">
    Consider weather conditions when promoting bicycle options to users.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Safety First">
    Ensure bicycle routing prioritizes safe cycling infrastructure where available.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clear Communication">
    Provide clear information about cycling segments including distance and estimated time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Future Enhancements

The multimodal service continues to evolve with additional transportation modes and enhanced journey planning capabilities. Future updates may include:

- Electric scooter integration
- Walking path optimization
- Real-time bicycle availability (bike share systems)
- Weather-based mode recommendations
