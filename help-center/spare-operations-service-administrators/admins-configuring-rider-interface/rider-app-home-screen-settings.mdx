## Use Cases

### Scheduled and Leave Now
Best for general-purpose transportation services where riders need flexibility for both planned and immediate trips.

**Example scenarios:**
- Public transit services
- General on-demand transportation
- Mixed-use transportation systems

### Scheduled Only
Ideal for services that require advance booking or have limited capacity.

**Example scenarios:**
- Paratransit services requiring advance notice
- Medical transportation with appointment scheduling
- Services with limited vehicle availability

### Leave Now Only
Perfect for high-frequency services focused on immediate transportation needs.

**Example scenarios:**
- Campus shuttle services
- High-frequency urban routes
- Emergency or urgent transportation services

## Impact on User Experience

<Info>
The home screen setting affects the initial interface riders see when opening the app. Riders can still access other booking modes through navigation if your service supports multiple trip types.

The home screen trip mode setting is managed through the Organization Rider App Settings API:

{
  "homeScreenTripMode": "scheduled_and_leave_now" | "scheduled_only" | "leave_now_only"
}
```

Changes to the home screen trip mode setting take effect immediately for new app sessions. Users may need to restart the app to see the updated interface.
