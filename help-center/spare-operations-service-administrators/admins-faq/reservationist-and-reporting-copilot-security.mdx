## Overview

Spare remains committed to providing an excellent user experience while adhering to security guidelines and best practices. This document addresses how Spare's latest features, **Reservationist Copilot** and **Reporting Copilot**, process and use data using artificial intelligence.

## AI Model

Both **Reservation** and **Analytics Copilot** utilize [Google's Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai?hl=en) solutions.

### Security and Compliance

- The **Vertex AI models** are all regionally co-hosted in the same data center as Spare Platform
- **Google Vertex AI** meets all necessary security standards and does not use prompts or associated information to improve its products. See [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#data-use-paid) for details

### Data Hosting Locations

At present, data is hosted in either:
