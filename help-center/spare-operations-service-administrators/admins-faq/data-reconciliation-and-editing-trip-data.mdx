## What is Data Reconciliation?

Data reconciliation is the process of comparing and aligning data from different sources to ensure accuracy and consistency, identifying and resolving discrepancies for reliable and unified datasets.

## How does it work?

Ensuring data accuracy is crucial for agencies relying on our platform to bill operators and secure funding from the FTA. Although Spare effectively automates data tracking, occasional inaccuracies arise, particularly in areas with limited cellular coverage and when drivers forget to mark pickup and drop-off in the app. Data Reconciliation enables agencies to rectify such inaccuracies, ensuring precise operator billing and regulatory reporting.

To edit metrics, ensure that this feature is turned on by asking your Spare Representative. Once enabled, you'll see **"Edit Metrics"** under **"Actions"** on any completed trips. There is no limit to how long you can edit metrics.

| On-Time Performance and Trip Lateness are calculated based on the time a driver arrives at a stop, not when the pick-up or drop-off was completed. Data Reconciliation only allows users to edit the completed times and locations of the slots, so the following metrics **are not updated **by Data Reconciliation:  | Service Metrics - OTP. |

Note that if the slot completion time remains the same, but the address changes, this metric will not update. |

## Other FAQ

### Does data reconciliation update On-time performance or Lateness Metrics?

**No** - On-Time Performance and Lateness is calculated based on when the driver arrived at a stop, not when they completed the pick-up or drop-off. Data Reconciliation only allows users to edit the completed pick-up or drop-off time and locations.

### Can I edit the payment method if a rider pre-paid with Stripe/Nimoca/Go Pass?

**No** - You can only edit the payment method if a rider paid with an in-vehicle payment method (cash/tickets/etc).

### If a rider paid with Stripe/Nimoca/Go Pass and I edit the number of passengers, will it refund or charge the rider?

**No** - changing the number of passengers does not result in refunds or charges in Stripe/Nimoca/Go Pass.
