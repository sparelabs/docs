When you search for a pickup or dropoff location within Spare, the search is done via **Google's "Place Autocomplete" API**.

This search will work without issue the vast majority of the time. However, on rare occasions the location included in the search does not reflect the reality of your area. If this happens, the driver may be directed to a different location than the rider expected.

> When you come across a situation like this, it's best to **submit feedback to Google** so they can correct the issue.

Below you will find directions to submit that feedback:

1. Navigate to [Google's Place Autocomplete page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete)

2. **Enter the location or address** in question to validate that it is showing the incorrect map location

3. Select the **"Send feedback"** button
