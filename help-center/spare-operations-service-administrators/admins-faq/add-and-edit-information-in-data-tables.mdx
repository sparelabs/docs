By clicking on the **column icon** at the top left of each of these tables, you'll be able to see:

- **Data points that are fixed**
- **Which ones are active**
- **What else is available to add**

> If you make changes that you don't like, you can always scroll to the bottom and select **"Reset to default"**.

### Managing columns

- **To add or remove columns** from your view, use the checkboxes on the left-hand side of the dropdown menu
- **To re-order columns**, click and drag on the two lines on the right-hand side of the dropdown menu 

## Who can see what I configure?

**Only you.** This means that every user can choose the information that's important to them.

## How often do I have to configure it?

Your configuration is saved to your user account, so it will be there each time you log in to your account, regardless of device or browser.
