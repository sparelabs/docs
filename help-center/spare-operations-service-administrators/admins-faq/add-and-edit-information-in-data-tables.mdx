You have information that you need to know at a glance, and you don't want to click into each individual trip, rider, or driver just to see that info. Now, you can pick and choose which information is displayed in tables across Spare! 

## Which tables can I configure?

You can configure the following tables:

- **Live Requests**
- **Requests**
- **Recurring Trips**
- **Riders**
- **Drivers**
- **Charges**
- **Promos**
- **Promo Allocations**
- **Fare Passes**
- **Fare Pass Allocations**
- **Vehicles**
- **Time Rules**
- **Duty Itinerary** (On the Duty Details page)
- **Payment Methods** (On the Payment Method Types page)
- **Requests** (On the Rider's Profile page)

and more!

## What can I configure?

By clicking on the **column icon** at the top left of each of these tables, you'll be able to see:

- **Data points that are fixed**
- **Which ones are active**
- **What else is available to add**

> If you make changes that you don't like, you can always scroll to the bottom and select **"Reset to default"**.

### Managing columns

- **To add or remove columns** from your view, use the checkboxes on the left-hand side of the dropdown menu
- **To re-order columns**, click and drag on the two lines on the right-hand side of the dropdown menu 

## Who can see what I configure?

**Only you.** This means that every user can choose the information that's important to them.

## How often do I have to configure it?

Your configuration is saved to your user account, so it will be there each time you log in to your account, regardless of device or browser.
