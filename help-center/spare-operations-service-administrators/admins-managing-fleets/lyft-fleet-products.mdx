Lyft has different Fleet products that they can offer to their riders and customers through Spare’s Lyft Open Fleets integration. The current Lyft Fleet products available through Spare are:

**Regular Lyft**

**Lyft Wait & Save****Lyft Wait and Save offers up to 10-20% lower cost compared to regular Lyft in exchange for an increased wait time. These rides are not shared and the wait time can range from 0-15 minutes depending on Lyft’s algorithm. Note that it’s not possible to book scheduled rides** for Lyft Wait and Save.

**Lyft XL **
For trips with more than 3 passengers.

**Lyft Assisted**
Lyft Assisted is a door-to-door service that Lyft launched for Lyft Business customers. Initially launched for Healthcare customers, Lyft Assisted offers the following benefits to riders:

When a rider takes an Assisted ride, they’ll be paired with a driver who is informed that the rider may want assistance.

The driver can meet at the front door of rider’s pick-up location, help them get in and out of the vehicle, and also accompany the rider to the door of their destination.

Drivers can also help load and unload light mobility devices (such as canes, walkers, crutches, and foldable wheelchairs)**​Note: **Only available in select regions. Please check with your Spare Representative.

**Lyft WAV**
When a wheelchair ride is requested, Lyft pairs the requester with available drivers who can accommodate a non-folding or motorized wheelchair or scooter. Wheelchair rides aren’t available in every market yet. The locations where a wheelchair ride can be requested can be found [here](https://help.lyft.com/hc/e/all/articles/115013081668#regions).
