## Getting Started: 2 Options to Choose From

Spare currently offers **two different versions of utilizing Lyft**: Lyft Promotion and Lyft Open Fleets. Both versions of utilizing Lyft have their differences, but both allow for a fully integrated Lyft trip booking, dispatching, and reporting experience through the Spare Platform.

**Lyft Promotion (US only)** gives agencies 100 free Lyft trips per month, with a max value of $100 per trip.

The other Lyft fleet option is to utilize **Lyft as an Open Fleet**. Prior to setting up a Lyft Open Fleet for an organization, Spare and the agency involved **require a contractual agreement** that indicates the payment process for the Lyft trips. In this case, customers contract with Spare directly, have the Lyft trips processed through the Spare Lyft account, and have Spare bill the customer (on behalf of Lyft).

## FAQs

### How will Lyft Interact With Other Fleets?

- Lyft interacts with other dedicated and non-dedicated fleets in multiple ways. You can select one of the following options:

**Lyft-first approach:** any rider that has opted into using Lyft will get Lyft as a priority, so long as booking limitations are not an issue. In this scenario at the **Service level**, the** Lyft Fleet is set to High Priority** while **Dedicated Fleets are set to low priority**, thus sending every Lyft opted-in rider a Lyft trip first, with the potential to get a dedicated vehicle if no Lyft driver accepts the trip offer.

**Lyft as an overflow service:** Lyft is being used only when a Dedicated Fleet trip is not available and/or is at capacity (i.e. waits are too long). For any rider that has opted in to using Lyft, their trips will first attempt to book to a Dedicated Fleet vehicle, and if no options are available and/or the wait is too long, then the trip will flow to Lyft. The **Lyft Fleet priority is then set to low**.

### Are there any booking constraints?

- **Rider profiles must have a primary phone number:** If a rider's profile does not have a primary phone number on file, the trip will fail to retrieve an estimate because Lyft requires a rider phone number to create a booking. If this is the case, you will see the "Unable to find trip…" error code

- **Only 3 riders can be booked per trip:** The system will only allow you to book a maximum of 3 riders on a Lyft trip.

- **No accessibility features or mobility device can be attached to a trip request:** Lyft cannot accommodate any large or permanent accessibility devices, such as wheelchairs. However, Lyft vehicles are typically able to accommodate riders using foldable mobility devices such as a walker.

- **Pooling is not supported:** Lyft currently does not allow pooling, individual trips only.

- **Only the first 100 characters of trip notes will transfer to the Lyft driver:** Lyft limits driver trip notes to 100 characters and so only the first 100 characters of a trip's notes will be shown to the Lyft driver.

Please note that Lyft is a curb-to-curb service. Lyft drivers will have the ability to call the rider once they arrive at the pickup location. We ask that you let riders know that they should be looking out for their Lyft vehicle.

### How to book a trip with Lyft?

- When booking a trip, the rider is able to book either an on-demand **“Leave as soon as possible”** or scheduled **“Leave at” **trip to Lyft. 

For **on-demand “Leave as soon as possible” **trips, the trip will be automatically dispatched to the Lyft driver network.

For **scheduled “Leave at”** trips, the trip will enter the **Processing** state and then will be offered to the Lyft driver network 10 minutes before the requested pickup time. When a trip has been dispatched to Lyft and is in **Processing**, the individual request will show **Dispatched to an External Fleet**.

![Trip page showing external fleet notification with dispatched status](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/970078239/a6971c9014c499b0457e4215/4SXMbcTjd_5k0DpHN4dQ_nduLj7lwtD2Cg.png?expires=1753820100&signature=d45ec5cb655d5544e996c3d32f39c183223e2da94a58140d5ac20498a87b8339&req=fScnFs52n4JWFb4f3HP0gBNNP%2FDk32LLS%2BHuaN9eRtSlSXvMqm7Htz%2FDWaQD%0AI2M%3D%0A)

Any **pre-booked trip** will enter Lyft’s trip dispatching system **10 minutes prior to the requested pickup**. Lyft’s system will then attempt to have a trip accepted up to** three times by three different drivers within 10 minutes.** If a trip is not accepted once after 10 minutes, the trip will **return to Spare Platform** for dedicated vehicle scheduling. 

Spare's Engine will then attempt to schedule the trip. If it cannot be done without violating any service parameters, the trip will then enter a Processing or No Drivers Available state. At this stage, a booking agent will need to cancel and rebook the trip within the Spare Platform for the trip to be dispatched back to Lyft.

### How riders are notified about their trip?

- When a rider takes a Lyft trip booked through Spare, two sets of text notifications are typically set up: notifications directly from Lyft with driver information, vehicle information, and driver phone number, and notifications from Spare indicating that a trip is booked and a vehicle arriving notification. 

Rider notifications through Spare should be set up for both** Processing **and** Accepted **states.

Notifications coming from Lyft are set up by Lyft and cannot be adjusted in Spare.

### What are the payment options for riders?

- Lyft as an organization does not accept cash fares. Spare utilizes an integration with Stripe to process credit and debit card payments. 

Any organization that intends to use Lyft must have **Stripe or another payment processing application** to pay for Lyft trip fares.

A monthly invoice is sent to Spare Accounting from Lyft. The Spare Accounting team confirms the total amount for each active service and forwards the bill to the customer.

### Where can I see the data from the Lyft trips?

- Part of Spare’s integration with Lyft is the full pass through of Lyft trip data to Spare. Within Spare Analytics, all dashboards and reports can be filtered to include services with Lyft or the Lyft Fleet, depending on the report. 

Additionally, individual trip data, including location history, trip times, and trip status changes, are provided both historically and for future trips on each Spare Rider Profile.

### How do I reach out to Lyft Support?

- If you need to reach out to the Lyft Support (e.g. a rider left their item in the vehicle), contact Spare's Support team and we'll reach out to Lyft on your behalf. 

## Top Tips for Booking Fantastic Lyft Trips!

**Communication with riders is always key!** Make sure that riders know to look out for a Lyft vehicle and driver. Riders will get a text message sent to the primary phone number on their Spare profile with the driver's phone number in case they need to get into contact with them.

Use the 100-character maximum in the trip notes we send to Lyft and **add as much detail on the pickup location as possible** (i.e. the business/building name, description, building, and/or unit number).

When booking a trip to/from a business location, **search by the business name** rather than the physical address (e.g. "Walmart" instead of "100 Main Street") on trip requests. This way, the business name shows to the Lyft driver!

**Encourage the rider to open the Lyft app from the Spare Rider app** and/or the Lyft notifications. When opening the Lyft app, the rider's location will be sent to the Lyft Driver App so that the Lyft driver can more easily locate the rider.
