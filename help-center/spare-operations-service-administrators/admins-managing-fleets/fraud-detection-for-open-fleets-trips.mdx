## About this feature

Fraud Detection for Open Fleets is a crucial functionality designed to protect transit agencies from fraudulent activities in services like Uber or Lyft, where riders or drivers can manipulate platforms to receive payment for rides never rendered to actual customers. This feature enables agencies to monitor and evaluate the fraud risk of riders, helping them identify and take action against fraudulent behavior by banning them from the system.

## How does it work?

### Identifying and Assessing Fraud Risk

Riders are assigned a Fraud Risk level—low, medium, or high—based on their ride history with open fleet drivers. 

This classification helps agencies identify potential fraudsters more effectively.

### High Fraud Risk

- A rider has more than 10 completed fraudulent trips within a week

### Medium Fraud Risk

- A rider completes more than 5 fraudulent trips within a week

### Low Fraud Risk

- Default risk level for new riders until data suggests otherwise

### User Interface for Fraud Monitoring

Agencies can filter and monitor riders by their fraud risk levels through the "Riders" page on their management interface. 

Each rider's profile displays their assigned fraud risk level, allowing for easy monitoring and management.
