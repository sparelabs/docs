In the realm of utilizing Uber's services, efficient planning and cost-effectiveness play a pivotal role. When working with Uber estimates, streamline the process by filtering based on the specific products enabled within their fleet. These estimates, thoughtfully provided by Uber, not only encompass essential trip details like pickup, destination, and time but also include crucial information about the vehicle's capacity.

Uber's approach involves a meticulous filtering process, excluding estimates that do not align with the specified rider capacity. This enhances focus on options that are not only viable but also practical for the number of passengers expected. By employing this filtering strategy, Uber ensures compatibility and a seamless user experience.

Furthermore, their backend logic comes into play as we navigate through the selection process. While Uber's estimate provides an overview of all our organization's enabled products, internal logic helps us make informed decisions. The goal is to pinpoint the most suitable product for each trip, ensuring optimal convenience for users.

In situations where multiple products prove to be viable for a given trip, we take an additional step to enhance cost efficiency. Our selection criteria prioritize the product with the lowest cost, ensuring to not only meet transportation needs but also do so in a financially prudent manner. This comprehensive approach ensures that interactions with Uber are not only seamless but also optimized for both compatibility and cost-effectiveness.
