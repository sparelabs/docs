There are circumstances when your riders might need to reach out for support. However, if there are multiple fleets associated with your service, it may be confusing.

With Fleet Support Links, you can add a unique support link to each fleet.  A rider will be provided with the appropriate link when they access information about a previous trip.

Fleet Support Links are especially helpful for Open Fleets where the service can be provided by Taxi companies or providers like Lyft and Uber.

## How to Set Up Fleet Support Links

Go to **Spare Operations** and jump into the **Service Planning** tab. Select **Fleets** and click on the **fleet name** you'd like to edit.

Add a **support link** and **save** the changes.
