Operators can allow fleets to be utilized by other providers. Service providers can use fleets from many external operators in a service.

Shared fleets enable an operator â†” service provider marketplace on the Spare Platform.

## How it works for Service Providers

If you are providing a service you have two options for fleets:

Your fleet is managed by your organization.

An external fleet managed by another organization.

To utilize an external fleet, you must ask the operator to share their fleet with you. 

For them to do this, they will need to follow the instructions below, "For Operators", and they will require your Organization ID. 

Once their fleet is shared with you, you will see their fleet in your list of fleets just like your own.

When you select the fleet, you should see that it is being shared with you by another organization, as shown below.

## How it works for Operators

As a fleet operator, you can share your fleet with other organizations, even if you use the fleet for your service. 

To share your fleet you must select the **fleet**, and press **"Share Fleet"** in the** Fleet Sharing pane**. 

You then need to add the Organization ID of the organization that you would like to share your fleet with, as shown below.

Once a fleet is shared, it will be **eligible to receive bookings **from any services that the fleet has been added to in the shared organization.
