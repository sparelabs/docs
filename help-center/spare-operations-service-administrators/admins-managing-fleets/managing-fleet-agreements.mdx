Fleet Agreements let agencies integrate fleet vendors like Lyft and local taxi cabs into their services, ensuring that the fleet provider’s terms of service and the FTA’s drug and alcohol regulations are satisfied. Fleet Agreements unlock the power of Open Fleets.

## ## Fleet Agreements in the Admin Panel**Step 1. Set up a Fleet 

Agreement**

- There’s a checkbox in the Fleets screen called “Requires agreement”. When checked, you can optionally provide a Terms and Conditions link for the fleet. This link is used in automated rider communications.

![Fleet setup page. Requires agreement ticked.](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/970455815/ae55bfdf864b171bf52ccf39/uJvLScDFSOAwi7EN5q45mEBqAWNicUZIWw.png?expires=1753820100&signature=6f6bcb3df010d8ea6ab08865a182f2bc3c088d25b36db64f0784be0cb85c340b&req=fScnEsx7lYBaFb4f3HP0gHGCN%2BA1QIe3%2BmRn4%2FzO2YSIz%2BZFhedPcWGK4bOz%0Ahq8%3D%0A)

**Step 2. View/Manage Fleet Agreements on the Fleet Details Page**

- If “Requires Fleet Agreements” is enabled, a “Rider-Fleet Agreements” section appears at the bottom of the Fleet details page.

![Fleet Details page. Fleet Agreement Table visible](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/970455821/7f7e6d776f9911b1c652db87/76GM3SQeRiNdkxIAbZeS-JCTPcmm3iT1sw.png?expires=1753820100&signature=06d80ecb49cdd09976e35c97067ef32986683f3cfd794839a38d5aaef5a89490&req=fScnEsx7lYNeFb4f3HP0gFDl5mnUqfA5A5O9AYZ6dd1uJX8a3iM3WB0kPDPC%0Af54%3D%0A)

**From here, you can:**

- Create a new rider-fleet agreement manually:

**Step 3. View/Manage Fleet Agreements from the Rider Profile**

- Open the Rider profile and scroll down to the Rider-Fleet Agreements section. Select an existing agreement record or click "+ Add Rider-Fleet Agreement"

## Fleet 

Agreements when creating a request

It is not possible to dispatch a trip to a fleet that requires a fleet agreement if the user has not opted in yet. If the selected service contains one or more fleets that the user has not agreed to ride, Spare will display a “Review Fleets” message. In this screenshot, the service has one fleet, and the rider hasn’t opted into using it:

![Create trip screen, with Fleet Agreement needed message](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/970455873/e5ea508bc918a7c426bbdfa2/I1J3XvW28xSAOcSU5TS-KTUTyR-fzHDi-A.png?expires=1753820100&signature=897c631e32b806fa22eec65b471d0073298deb5c6404011baf35e90965fded85&req=fScnEsx7lYZcFb4f3HP0gNoef93hAb4FwuGs0zwozmcm1HEH2duDc3pn9frb%0AmGQ%3D%0A)

Once the "Review Fleets" button is clicked, an agent will get redirected to the following screen:

![Screen showing an example Uber Fleet Agreement with options to share the Terms and Conditions by SMS or email](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/970455887/116c6de1550a8ece99bd8ee4/7JsE3N7sH5-JUsyL2VzXLUVBnuQ7RV_-eQ.png?expires=1753820100&signature=8307f11173f50b6247f7f4695f42df1edb31a2f7948584584c0fe7ab12ac954a&req=fScnEsx7lYlYFb4f3HP0gKUDuU3XVwYmGedX7qRBc%2BBDcmX76tIE25xi6Qxy%0AWdo%3D%0A)

The booking agent must verbally get approval from the rider before pressing ‘I agree’ or ‘Not right now.’

The booking agent can optionally send a terms and conditions link to the rider by SMS or Email. This option is only displayed if the Fleet has a terms and conditions link associated with it. If a rider only has a phone number or email address, one option is displayed.

Pressing ‘I agree’ creates a ‘Rider-Fleet’ agreement for the rider and gives them access to the fleet, and generates a new estimate.

## Fleet Agreements in the Rider App**Step 1. "Agree and 

Continue"**

- When a rider has confirmed their origin and destination, Spare checks the following information:

Which services could serve a ride between the requested origin and destination at the requested time? Services that aren’t available to rider interfaces, to the specific rider, don’t cover both the origin and destination, or don’t operate at that time will be excluded.

Are there any fleets connected to those services that require agreement?

Of those fleets, are there any that the rider hasn’t already agreed to?

Of those fleets, are there any that the rider hasn't been asked to agree to in the last 30 days?

If any fleets require the rider's agreement, Spare will show a screen asking for each one.

A fleet with a brand image and Terms and Conditions link will appear like this:

![Lyft Fleet Agreement prompt on rider app](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/970455898/4082672f621afe9b4daceb03/j3Flu5tFamsTed_WmJxrsBBreEtyRQcbBA.png?expires=1753820100&signature=1a4d433b523b370008359889f0bebeef4d41108c2da9fd1fd1e078e8b49cc16c&req=fScnEsx7lYhXFb4f3HP0gOSCzrVDOir1wmqmxQphUhFgWO%2BDJgVW7fgQfrQD%0ASAQ%3D%0A)
A fleet with no brand image and no Terms and Conditions link will appear like this:
​

![Generic Fleet Agreement screen on the rider app](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/970455905/26b4b6baa9581ec876f63781/vIilpxRRobwRfEpKcM_-GGvgWEwMochtpg.png?expires=1753820100&signature=d2b3b2442cdd6832915e31017a4ec3739e7e2c13f7a8d7f55840015e7972b6d1&req=fScnEsx7lIFaFb4f3HP0gBY6NIjsfo4KFBfQ4uDVvvG1O9KMuOlpOBgxHXdt%0AfhU%3D%0A)

If the rider taps “Agree and Continue”, a Fleet Agreement will be created and set to “Yes”. If the rider taps “Maybe Later”, a Fleet Agreement will still be created, but it will be set to “No”.

**Step 2. Trip Estimates**

- Next, the rider will see the Estimates screen. Spare always shows accurate estimates, so the estimates the rider will see will be better if they have agreed to more fleets.

If the rider hasn’t agreed to any of the fleets connected to a particular service, that service will be unavailable and marked as “No rides available”.

If the rider hasn’t agreed to any of the fleets connected to a particular service, that service will be unavailable and marked as “No rides available”.

The “McKinney Ride” service shown in these images is an example of how a service looks when one or more fleets have been agreed to vs when none of its fleets have been agreed to.

**Step 3. The Ride**

- If the rider proceeds to book a ride, they will only be matched with fleets they’ve agreed to ride with.

If the rider is matched to a dedicated or shared fleet, the regular in-trip screen is shown.

If the rider is matched to an Open Fleet, the in-trip screen includes some extra features:

Text saying the name of the fleet and reassuring riders their fare is the same as the estimate they saw previously.

An “About This Ride” section that can accommodate more information and can link to the fleet’s app if one exists

![Driver arrives in 10 min screen](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/970455930/14f5d96879e14b1682a9bf45/QlvZftrEGUDTPFNS5Emz37seByqfyGA2mw.png?expires=1753820100&signature=124abd1561a3dadd19bf384e57c803b9599317e8a5582607797ba9ba166410b3&req=fScnEsx7lIJfFb4f3HP0gIcAGWpw%2FJJdTBvtLZxGv1qDzajdJnsABiyz2osH%0AO4M%3D%0A)

**Step 4. After the Drop-off**

- After a ride with an Open Fleet, extra options are available on the Past Trip screen:

The text about the fleet providing the ride is repeated

A button to contact support

A button to view ride history in the fleet’s app if one exists

![Past Trip details screen](https://spare-74fa64f80617.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/970455942/bdf524e5b92293bfc1b311af/QfsTx5QWHP5Vsfrgg3Cv5WhiHksDmvBijA.png?expires=1753820100&signature=e3b20697da812f3da6dc3b9f94c995b89f42be64dafdf2125cf2bccc6c46aa35&req=fScnEsx7lIVdFb4f3HP0gI3p2Icz5%2FIin8hJYP34Bd4w891geIXCwXdIkHze%0AXcA%3D%0A)**​Step 5. Viewing or opting out of fleets**

- All the fleets a rider has agreed to ride with are shown in the rider app under the “Fleet Agreements” menu. A rider who previously agreed but has changed their mind can end the agreement. They will be asked to confirm before the agreement is ended.
