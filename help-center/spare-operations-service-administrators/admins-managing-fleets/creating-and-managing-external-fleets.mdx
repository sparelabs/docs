Note that when a fleet requires an agreement, only riders who have agreed can be matched to this fleet’s duties.

## Configuring Fleet Prioritization

Once the fleet is created, add it to your existing service.

To do so, go to the **Service Planning tab** and select **Services**. Then click on the **Service name** you'd like the fleet to be associated with.

Click Edit Service and scroll down to Fleet Connections. Click + Add Fleet Connection and type in the external fleet name (e.g., Lyft).

Click Edit Service and scroll down to Fleet Connections. Click + Add Fleet Connection and type in the external fleet name.

Select the fleet priority: High, Medium, or Low.

Spare will attempt to match requests first to High, then Medium, then Low-priority fleets. If the request can't be matched to any of those fleets, Spare will attempt to match to any remaining fleets, in order of lowest wait time.

**Save Fleet Connection **changes. 

Set the **Fleet Priority Wait Time Threshold** (min)

Fleet Priority Wait Time threshold allows you to control the way requests are distributed across different fleets.

When the wait time is below the threshold, the requests are matched based on fleet priority.

When the wait time is above the threshold, the requests are matched by the lowest wait time.

**Save all changes** in the service settings.
