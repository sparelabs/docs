When trip requests go to the Uber Open Fleet, they are **displayed the same** way as Spare trip requests and can be found on the **Requests general page**.

Additionally, the requests are available on the Live Map, where the vehicle location and details are shown just like dedicated vehicles.

## Uber Open Fleet Key Facts

**Available in selected countries:** US, Canada, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, India, Australia, and New Zealand. 

**Rider Profiles Must Have a Primary Phone Number**

- If a rider’s profile does not have a primary phone number on file, the trip will fail to retrieve an estimate because Uber requires a rider's phone number to create a booking. If this is the case, you will see the “Unable to find trip…” error code.

**Up to 6 riders per trip:** UberX & UberXL options allow to accommodate up to 5-6 riders.

**No Accessibility Features**

- Uber cannot accommodate any accessibility devices (e.g. wheelchairs).

**Trip Notes 599 Character Limit**

- Uber limits driver trip notes to 599 characters. We recommend using them to add as much detail as possible about a rider's pickup location.

**Anonymized phone number**

Uber provides the following information:
- Driver: first name, photo, and anonymized phone number
- Vehicle: license plate, make, model, color, passenger seats

An anonymized phone number means that Uber disconnects the number once the request is complete, and it can no longer be called.

## What Will Riders Experience?

After a trip has been booked, riders will receive **SMS messages** for the [following events](https://help.uber.com/business/article/text-messages-riders-receive?nodeId=1d773c1e-db7c-4a9a-bb98-7c8a8f89eb23&_csid=4ayPHVfxEn15ba30r5iIJg&state=M-SIAMsoobq9lpqPl_0DMcsMjUxmbXJ_NJfe_g3G4AA%3D&effect=), including Uber's [Terms & Conditions](https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=general-terms-of-use&country=canada&lang=en). Riders will continue to receive **Spare Platform notifications** as they would normally as well.

Please note that Uber is a curb-to-curb service. Uber drivers will have the ability to call the rider once they arrive at the pickup location. We ask that you let riders know that they should be looking out for their Uber vehicle.

## What Trips Can Uber Accommodate?

You are able to book either an on-demand **"Leave as soon as possible"** or scheduled **"Leave at"** trip to Uber.

For on-demand “Leave as soon as possible” trips, the trip will be automatically dispatched to the Uber driver network.

For scheduled “Leave at” trips, the trip will enter the **Processing** state and then will be offered to the Uber driver network shortly before the requested pickup time.

## Top Tips for Booking Uber Trips

**Communication with riders is always key!** Make sure that riders know to look out for an Uber vehicle and driver. Riders will get a text message sent to the primary phone number on their Spare profile with the driver's phone number in case they need to get in contact with them.

**Use the 599 character maximum** in the trip notes we send to Uber and **add as much detail on the pickup location as possible** (i.e., the business/building name, description, building and/or unit number).

When booking a trip to/from a business location, always **search by the business name** rather than the physical address (e.g., “Walmart” instead of “100 Main Street”) on trip requests. This way, the business name shows to the Uber driver!

## How do I reach out to Uber Support?

Riders can contact Uber support directly through the Uber app for any issues related to lost and found, driver issues, vehicle issues, etc. Requests booked in Spare will be visible in the Uber app if the user has an existing Uber account and is matched through either their phone number or email.
