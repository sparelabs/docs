## Fleet Sliders

Fine-tuning your organization within the Spare Platform to ensure your service is accomplishing your goals and behaving optimally is an ongoing process after a service launches.

One of the customizable features within the Spare Platform to help optimize your service is the **Fleet Sliders**, which can be found within the Fleet's settings.

Fleet slider settings are applied only to fleets selected and do not impact other fleets connected to your service.

To **edit** or look at your fleet sliders, simply head into **"Service Planning"** in Spare Operations and select **"Fleets".** From here you'll want to select the fleet you'd like to look into or edit, then hit **"Edit Fleet"** in the top right-hand corner. From here, you should be able to view the fleet name, driver wait time threshold, and fleet sliders as below:

Two fleet sliders can impact your service, the first being the **System Efficiency Ratio Slider** and the second being the **Wait Time vs. Detour Time Slider.**

## System Efficiency Ratio Slider

The Spare Team has found this slider to be extremely impactful for services encouraging an increase in ridership or trying to fit in more trips with limited resources. 

**When shifted towards the right (more efficient)**, the fleet slider guides the algorithm to try to **fit more trips** in and take advantage of post-match parameters to do so. We've seen services go from 2 riders on the vehicle at once to 5 riders on the vehicle at once simply by shifting this slider to the right.

Moving the **System Efficiency Ratio slider to the left** encourages a **better rider experience**, including **less time on the vehicle.** While you may accommodate fewer trips, this will reduce the amount of time spent on the vehicle, and, as a result, the rider experience for the trips that you can accommodate will improve.

## Wait Time vs. Detour Time Slider

The movement of the wait time vs. detour time slider is guided more by the preference of riders using the service. 

Moving the slider towards **"minimize wait time"** may allow the rider to be **picked up earlier, though they may be on the vehicle longer.**

On the opposite side of the spectrum, you can **"minimize detour"** and **pick up the rider later so they're on the vehicle for less time**, though they may have to wait longer for their pickup.

The movement of this slider can be guided by the **preference** of riders, the **climate** of the region, the **type of service** you're providing, and a multitude of other factors.

For example, in a cold climate where riders may be waiting outside, they may prefer to be in the vehicle for longer to avoid waiting in unpleasant weather. On the opposite side of the spectrum, if you're providing service from a hub or location with activities, a rider may prefer to wait longer at their location and spend less time on the vehicle.

## Spare's Recommendations

Spare advises you to keep the sliders in the middle or slightly move them in the required directions, but not more than 2/3 of the line.

You can also play with the settings using [Spare's Optimization Insights Simulation](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/8994031-optimization-insights) tool. Using your organization's data, the tool will instantly show the anticipated efficiency changes.
