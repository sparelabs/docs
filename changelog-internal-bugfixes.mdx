  ### Request History Display (ENGINE-112)

  ### East Bay Paratransit Booking Rules (BUS-3786)

  **Issue**

  East Bay Paratransit trips could be booked with only free riders (like Personal Care Attendants or children), creating a loophole for free rides and violating service requirements.

  **Resolution**

  You can no longer book an East Bay Paratransit trip with only free riders. All trips now require at least one paying rider, which keeps everything in line with service requirements.
