## Admin

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Group Membership Metadata Preservation on Update (ENG-831)**
  - _Resolution_: Corrected an issue where updating a single metadata field on a group membership via the API would unintentionally wipe out all other existing metadata. Partial updates now correctly merge with existing data.

---

## Admin

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Service Availability for Estimates in Zoned Services (BUS-3786)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where some services would not appear as available during the initial estimate phase due to time-based zone rules. The system now validates geography first and applies time-based rules only after a specific trip time has been selected.

### üë§ Enhanced Security for Admin and Driver Profile Photos

### 

**What's New**  
Profile photo URLs for administrators and drivers now use secure, temporary links, enhancing data privacy. As part of this update, the "Photo" column has been removed from the main list views for Drivers and Admins, aligning their behavior with the existing security model for Riders.


**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *People > Drivers* (list view)
- *Settings > Team > Admins* (list view)

#### What You Can Do
- You will no longer see the "Photo" column in the main data tables for drivers and administrators.
- Profile photos remain visible on individual driver and admin profile pages.

#### Why This Matters
This change enhances security by ensuring that profile photos are not accessible via permanent, public links. Removing the photo column from list views also improves page load performance for organizations with many drivers or admins.

### ‚úàÔ∏è New Cross-Region Data Migration Tool

### 

**What's New**  
A new tool is available for Super Admins to migrate data between organizations in different geographical regions. The new interface provides a dedicated workflow for selecting source and destination regions, choosing specific data items to migrate, and viewing detailed results.


**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Super Admin > Data Migrations* (new page at `/super-admin/cross-region-data-migrations`)

#### What You Can Do
- Select a source and destination region (e.g., US, EU) from new dropdown menus.
- Choose the source and destination organizations for the migration.
- Select specific items to migrate, such as Services, Zones, Riders, and Fare Passes, using a detailed checklist.
- Initiate the migration and monitor progress in the "Migration Results" panel.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, migrating configurations between regions was a manual, error-prone process. This purpose-built tool streamlines cross-region setups, making it faster and more reliable for Super Admins to launch new services or duplicate configurations across Spare's global infrastructure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Set a Default Country for Your Organization

### 

**What's New**  
Administrators can now set a default country for their organization. This country's flag and dialing code will automatically appear in phone number fields, such as when adding a new rider, streamlining data entry for international operations.


**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator or Super admin permissions


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Settings > Organization > General* (new "Default Country" dropdown)
- *People > Riders > Add Rider* (phone number input field)
- *Super Admin > Organizations > Edit/New Organization* (new "Default Country" dropdown)

#### What You Can Do
- Set a "Default Country" for your organization from a comprehensive list.
- When creating a new rider, the phone number input will automatically default to the selected country's flag and dialing code (e.g., +44 for the UK).

#### Why This Matters
This feature simplifies data entry for agencies operating outside the US. By pre-selecting the correct country code, it reduces manual effort and minimizes the risk of entering incorrect phone numbers for riders.

### üó∫Ô∏è Simplified Multimodal Graph Configuration

### 

**What's New**  
The interface for managing Multimodal graphs has been completely redesigned and moved directly into each organization's settings. This new organization-centric view simplifies configuration, shows the current build status of the graph, and includes a "Request Rebuild" button to easily trigger an update.


**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Super Admin > Organizations > (select an organization) > Multimodal Graph tab*

#### What You Can Do
- View and manage all multimodal graph settings for a single organization in one place.
- Check the "Graph Status" card to see when the graph was last built and if it's up to date.
- Click the "Request Rebuild" button to trigger a new graph build after updating datasets.
- Add, edit, and remove datasets (e.g., GTFS, Flex) in a context that is filtered to the specific organization.

#### Why This Matters
The previous graph management UI was complex and required navigating region-wide lists, increasing the risk of configuration errors. This new, streamlined workflow is more intuitive and reduces errors by scoping all actions to a single organization.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Timezone-Aware Filtering and Data Exports

### 

**What's New**  
Filtering and exporting data now consistently use your organization's configured timezone. This ensures that date/time filters and exported timestamps accurately reflect your local time, preventing confusion from UTC-based values.


**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This applies to date/time filters and export functionality on most list pages, such as *Rides > All Rides*, *Operations > Duties*, and *People > Riders*.

#### What You Can Do
- When you apply a date filter (e.g., for "today"), it will now be based on your organization's local timezone.
- When you export data to CSV or XLSX, all timestamp columns will be displayed in your local timezone.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, some filters and exports were based on UTC, which could lead to confusion and incorrect data analysis for teams in different timezones. This change ensures that the data you see and export from Spare Admin always aligns with your real-world operational hours.

## AI Voice

### ü§ñ More Accurate Date Recognition for Rider Authentication

### 

**What's New**  
AI Voice now uses a more rigorous process for understanding dates of birth during rider authentication. It will now reject ambiguous spoken dates to prevent incorrect matches, while correctly handling a wider variety of date formats.


**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a non-visual change that affects the AI Voice authentication workflow when a rider calls in.

#### What You Can Do
- Riders can state their date of birth in various formats, such as "June 6th 2025" or "2025 06 01," and the system will understand it correctly.
- If a rider provides an ambiguous date like "one one ninety two" (which could mean January 1st or November 1st), the system will now prompt for clarification instead of making a guess.

#### Why This Matters
This change improves the accuracy and security of the AI Voice authentication process. By rejecting ambiguous dates, it reduces the chance of authenticating the wrong rider, while improved recognition of valid formats creates a smoother experience for callers.
</Accordion>

## Analytics

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Ridership Report Payment Method Name (BUS-4303)**
  - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue in the Analytics V2 Ridership Report where the name for the payment method was not being correctly captured.

---

## Analytics

### üìä Link Case Data with Assignee Details in Reports

### 

**What's New**  
In Analytics, you can now connect `Case Data` to `Organization Admin` details in your reports. This allows you to include information about the admin assigned to a case, such as their name or phone number, directly in your case-related analysis.


**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder*

#### What You Can Do
- Create a report using `Case Data` as the primary data source.
- Add measures, dimensions, or filters from the `Organization Admin` data source to your report.
- For example, you can now build a report that shows the number of open cases assigned to each individual administrator by name.

#### Why This Matters
Before this change, it was not possible to join case data with the details of the assigned administrator, limiting reporting capabilities. This new relationship unlocks deeper insights into agent workload and case management performance.
</Accordion>

## Analytics

### üìä Query Group Membership Custom Fields Directly

### 

**What's New**  
Custom fields for Group Memberships are now directly available for querying in Analytics. This allows you to build reports using group membership custom data without needing to join through the ridership report.


**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder*

#### What You Can Do
- When building a report, select the `Group Memberships` data source (cube).
- You will now see your organization's group membership custom fields available as dimensions for filtering and grouping.
- For example, you can now create a report showing a count of members broken down by a custom field like `certification_level`.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, accessing group membership custom fields in reports was complex and required using the ridership report as a starting point. This change makes these fields first-class citizens in Analytics, enabling more direct and powerful reporting on member data.

## Operations

### ‚è±Ô∏è Smarter Scheduling for Duty Interruptions

### 

**What's New**  
When creating a duty interruption (like an impromptu break), the system now intelligently handles situations where the duty is ending soon. If the full interruption doesn't fit, the system will automatically create a shorter one if possible and notify you of the adjustment.


**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access


<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Operations > Live Map > (select a duty) > Breaks tab* (when using the "Add Break" button)

#### What You Can Do
- Create an immediate interruption for a driver near the end of their duty.
- The system will automatically shorten the interruption to the maximum possible duration if the requested length exceeds the remaining duty time.
- Receive a notification confirming that the interruption was created but shortened to fit the duty schedule.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, attempting to create an interruption that was longer than the remaining duty time would simply fail without a clear explanation. This enhancement prevents failures by creating the longest possible interruption and provides clear feedback, saving dispatchers time and reducing frustration.
</Accordion>

## Resolve

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Address Field Headers in Form Table of Contents (ENG-708)**
  - _Resolution_: Resolved a bug where section headers from the address input field (e.g., "Search for an address") were incorrectly appearing in the table of contents when viewing forms in Resolve or Engage. The address search input has also been visually updated for better consistency.

</Update>
