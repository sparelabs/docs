### üìû Notification Delivery Policy Management

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
Administrators can now view and edit Notification Delivery Policies directly in the admin interface, configuring primary and fallback phone numbers for SMS notifications.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Settings > Advanced > Notification Delivery Policies** - new section in organization settings
- **Requires Administrator access or Super admin permissions**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What You Can Do">
- View all notification delivery policies for your organization
- Edit primary sender phone numbers for SMS notifications
- Choose between phone number or alphanumeric sender ID as the primary sender
- Configure fallback phone numbers for redundancy
- Remove fallback numbers when not needed
- Phone number autocomplete shows the number first, then appends any user-generated name for clarity
- System validates that external call phone numbers are registered as Twilio Verified Caller IDs
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
SMS notifications are critical for rider communication - appointment reminders, trip updates, service alerts. Previously, configuring which phone numbers send these messages required backend access or support tickets. Now, administrators can manage notification delivery policies themselves, ensuring messages come from the right numbers and have proper fallbacks configured. The validation for Twilio Verified Caller IDs prevents configuration errors that would cause message delivery failures. The ability to switch between phone numbers and alphanumeric sender IDs gives you flexibility in how your organization's messages appear to recipients, which can improve brand recognition and message trust.

### üîç Superbox Search Result Highlighting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
Search results in Superbox now highlight matching text, making it immediately clear why each result was returned and which custom fields matched your search.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Superbox search** - global search bar throughout the admin interface
- **Rider and Driver search results** - when custom fields match the search query
- **No feature flags required**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What You Can Do">
- See highlighted text in search results showing exactly what matched your query
- When custom fields match, the matching field is displayed and highlighted
- Titles and subtitles are highlighted when they match your search terms
- For long custom field matches, the display is limited to preserve screen space while still showing the match
- All searchable types (riders, drivers, vehicles, etc.) support highlighting
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
When searching through riders, drivers, or other records, especially those with custom fields, it wasn't always obvious why a particular result appeared. You might search for a phone number stored in a custom field and get results, but have to open each one to figure out which field matched. Now, the matching text is highlighted and custom fields that match are displayed right in the search results. This makes search much more efficient - you can immediately see why each result was returned and often find what you need without opening the full record. It's especially valuable when searching by custom field values like alternate phone numbers, member IDs, or other organization-specific data.

### üí∞ Unlimited Promo Codes

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
When creating or editing promo codes, you can now set them to have unlimited usage amount or unlimited users, removing previous restrictions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Settings > Promo Codes** - when creating or editing promo codes
- **No feature flags required** - available to users with promo code management permissions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What You Can Do">
- Check "Unlimited Amount" to remove the maximum dollar amount restriction
- Check "Unlimited Users" to remove the user limit restriction
- Create promo codes that can be used by any number of riders
- Create promo codes with no cap on total discount value
- Combine unlimited options as needed for your promotion strategy
- Clear validation messages guide you when fields are required vs optional
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
Previously, all promo codes required setting a maximum amount and user limit, which was restrictive for certain promotional strategies. If you wanted to run an open-ended promotion or provide unlimited discounts to a specific group, you had to set artificially high limits and monitor usage manually. Now, you can create truly unlimited promo codes for scenarios like employee benefits, community partnerships, or open promotional campaigns. This gives you more flexibility in your marketing and outreach strategies without workarounds or manual monitoring.

### üîç Exact Match Search with Quotes

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
You can now perform exact match searches in Superbox and other search fields by wrapping your search term in double quotes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Superbox search** - global search bar
- **Any searchable field** throughout the admin interface
- **No feature flags required**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What You Can Do">
- Search for `"1234"` to find only records where a field exactly equals "1234"
- Without quotes, searching for `1234` returns partial matches like "12345", "01234", "1234567"
- With quotes, you get only exact matches
- Works with phrases too: `"John Smith"` finds exact name matches
- Particularly useful for short IDs, numbers, or common names
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
When searching for riders with very short names or low ID numbers, you'd often get hundreds of irrelevant results. Searching for rider "10" would return riders 10, 101, 102, 210, 1001, etc. Now, searching for `"10"` returns only rider 10. This dramatically speeds up finding specific records when you know the exact value you're looking for, especially for IDs, short codes, or common names. The quoted search feature saves time and reduces frustration when you need precision.
