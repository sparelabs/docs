<Update label="July 31, 2025" description="Platform Updates">
  ## Enhanced Custom Fields with "Other" Option
  
  We've added a new feature flag that allows agencies to include an "Other" option in custom fields, giving riders more flexibility when filling out forms. This is particularly useful for eligibility applications and booking forms where predefined options might not cover all scenarios.
  
  **Contact your Spare representative to enable this feature.**

  ## Improved Integration Sync Capabilities
  
  We've made significant improvements to our integration sync services, particularly for agencies using Rider360 and Access LA systems:
  
  - **Enhanced Group Membership Sync**: Better handling of rider group memberships and eligibility status synchronization
  - **Improved Data Accuracy**: More reliable sync processes with better error handling and validation
  - **Streamlined Configuration**: Simplified setup for sync services with better logging and monitoring
  
  These improvements ensure that rider data stays consistent across all connected systems.

  ## EAM Service API Key Management
  
  Spare EAM now supports API key operations, making it easier for agencies to integrate with external maintenance and fleet management systems. This enables automated data exchange for work orders, asset tracking, and maintenance scheduling.
  
  **Contact your Spare representative to learn more about EAM API integrations.**

  ## Multimodal Journey Enhancements
  
  We've expanded our multimodal trip planning capabilities to include bicycle as a supported mode of transport. Riders can now see bicycle options as part of their journey planning, making it easier to combine different transportation methods for complete door-to-door trips.

  ## Case Management Improvements for Eligibility
  
  ![Case Tags](/images/changelogs/platform-case-tags.png)
  
  Spare Eligibility now includes enhanced case management with tagging capabilities. Staff can now:
  
  - **Add custom tags to cases** for better organization and filtering
  - **Track case categories** more effectively with visual indicators
  - **Improve workflow efficiency** by quickly identifying case types and priorities
  
  This makes it easier to manage large volumes of eligibility applications and track different case types through the review process.

  ## AI Voice Booking Improvements
  
  We've resolved an issue where AI Voice agents could sometimes appear to book trips during conversation testing. The system now properly handles test scenarios without creating actual trip bookings, ensuring more reliable AI agent training and configuration.

  ## Fare Rule System Updates
  
  We've migrated several fare calculation systems to our new schema-based approach, improving reliability and making fare rules easier to maintain. These updates affect specific regional implementations and don't change how fares are calculated for riders.

  ## Stay ahead of service disruptions with Watchlist on Live Map
  
  ![Watchlist](/images/changelogs/platform-watchlist.png)
  
  We've added a new **[Watchlist](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/11324242-watchlist-on-the-live-map)** feature directly to the Live Map to help dispatchers catch and resolve issues, *before* they impact service.
  
  **Dispatchers now get a real-time view of key issues like:**
  - Late pull-outs
  - Prolonged or unexpected stops
  - Vehicles offline for over 5 minutes
  - Idle vehicles outside the service zone
  
  The Watchlist makes it easier to manage day-of operations proactively, helping agencies avoid delays and deliver more reliable service. **Contact your Spare representative to learn more or request early access.**

  ## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Manage permissions by group, role, and more
  
  We've introduced a new permissions system to help admins manage user access more precisely. **With Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), you can now:**
  
  - **Create user groups:** Organize users by role, team, or function
  - **Assign roles via access grants:** Link groups to Spare's predefined roles like scheduler or admin
  - **Set data scope:** Apply permissions org-wide or limit them to specific objects (like individual fleets)
  
  Whether you're managing a multi-operator setup or streamlining onboarding, this system makes permissions easier and more flexible. **Now live for all customers.**

  ## Smarter scheduling for Eligibility appointments
  
  ![Eligibility Appointments](/images/changelogs/platform-eligibility-appointments.png)
  
  We've rolled out a set of updates to make **[Eligibility appointments](https://help.sparelabs.com/en/articles/10151910-appointment-scheduling-for-eligibility)** more intuitive and efficient to use.
  
  **What's new:**
  - **Team View:** See your whole team's schedule in one place to quickly spot gaps and overlaps
  - **Unavailable hours:** Block off just a few hours when you're not available, ideal for short breaks or ad-hoc needs
  - **Quicker access:** Now you can book appointments and adjust availability directly from the homepage
  
  These updates make it easier to coordinate and manage team schedules. **Now live for all Eligibility customers.**

  ## Other improvements
  
  - **Set AI Agent forwarding hours for smarter support:** You can now set custom hours for when your AI Agent should forward calls to live supportâ€”including holidays
  - **Add pickup and drop-off notes to every trip with AI Voice:** AI Voice will now include helpful notes, like landmarks or exact locations, so drivers can find riders more easily
  - **Shared phone numbers for riders:** Multiple riders can now share one phone number while keeping separate profiles
  - **Duty cancellation improvements:** We've added a new way to track why duties are canceled with preset options and notes
  - **Smarter forms fields:** Editable address search & Phone number validation now available

  ## Rider Representatives
  ### Let trusted partners book and manage rides for your riders
  
  ![Rider Representatives](/images/changelogs/platform-rider-representatives.png)

  ## Keep ADA paratransit trips compliant and on time!
  
  ![Fixed Route Detour](/images/changelogs/platform-fixed-route-detour.png)
  
  Spare now automatically calculates detour limits based on the equivalent fixed route trip length and uses this to guide how trips are dispatched, ensuring riders aren't delayed beyond what they'd experience on a bus. This removes manual checks, streamlines operations, and simplifies NTD reporting.
  
  *The first phase of this release is currently available for Leave-At Trips only. Interested in enabling this feature? Please contact your Spare representative.*

<Update label="February 18, 2025" description="Automatic Overrides & Activity Feed">
  ## Smarter, more adaptive trip assignments

Automatic Overrides lets Spare Engine make intelligent adjustments in these edge cases, reducing dispatcher workload while keeping service efficient and reliable.
