### üé® Custom Summary Bar Views

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
You can now create, customize, and manage your own custom views for case lists in both Resolve and Eligibility, with personalized filters, column configurations, and default view settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Resolve > Cases** - case list page with new configurable summary bar
- **Eligibility > Cases** - case list page with new configurable summary bar
- **Requires `ConfigurableSummaryBar` feature flag**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What You Can Do">
- Create custom views using the "+" button (or dropdown menu when you have 6+ views)
- Name your custom views and optionally save current filters with them
- Reorder views by dragging and dropping them in the dropdown menu
- Set a default view that loads automatically when you open the case list
- Rename or delete existing custom views
- Save filter changes to existing views
- Each view remembers its own column configuration and sorting preferences
- Switch between built-in views (like "All Cases") and your custom views instantly
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
Different team members often need to see cases filtered in different ways - maybe you always want to see high-priority cases, or cases assigned to you, or cases in a specific status. Previously, you'd have to manually apply the same filters every time. Now, you can create views for your most common workflows and switch between them with a single click. The ability to set a default view means you see exactly what you need the moment you open the case list, saving time every single day. Column configurations are saved per view, so you can have different columns visible for different types of case reviews.
</Accordion>

### üñ®Ô∏è Multi-Page Form Printing

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
Printing case forms now correctly displays all pages of content, whether printing directly from a form view or from the peek view.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Eligibility > Cases > Forms tab** - when printing forms
- **Resolve > Cases > Forms tab** - when printing forms
- Available in both direct form view and peek view
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Changed">
- **Before**: When printing case forms, only the first page of content would appear, with subsequent pages showing repeated or cut-off content. Printing from peek view would also include unwanted background content from the case view.
- **Now**: _All form content prints correctly across multiple pages. When printing from peek view, only the form content prints (no background page content). Form field labels stay with their values across page breaks._
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
Printed forms are often required for compliance, record-keeping, or sharing with external partners who don't have system access. When only the first page printed, you'd lose critical information and have to find workarounds or manually compile complete records. Now, you can confidently print any form knowing you'll get a complete, properly formatted document. The peek view printing fix is especially important for workflows where you're reviewing multiple forms quickly - you can print what you need without closing the peek view or dealing with unwanted content.
</Accordion>

### üîÑ Forms Tab Navigation Persistence

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
When viewing forms in the case peek view, the Forms tab now stays selected as you navigate between different forms.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Eligibility > Cases > Forms tab** - when using peek view to view forms
- **Resolve > Cases > Forms tab** - when using peek view to view forms
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Changed">
- **Before**: Clicking on a form in the Forms tab would cause the tab to deselect and revert to the Activity Feed tab, making it confusing to navigate between multiple forms.
- **Now**: _The Forms tab remains selected as you click through different forms in the peek view, maintaining your context and making it easy to review multiple forms in sequence._
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
When reviewing case forms, you often need to look at multiple forms in succession - comparing information, checking completion status, or reviewing a series of related forms. Having the tab constantly switch back to Activity Feed was disorienting and added unnecessary clicks to get back to where you were. This fix makes the forms review workflow feel natural and efficient, especially when you're processing many cases or conducting thorough case reviews.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### ‚è±Ô∏è Case Summary Timer Field Update

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
The case summary now displays "Time Until Limit" instead of "Timer", showing the actual deadline rather than the configured limit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Resolve > Case Details** - case summary section
- **Eligibility > Case Details** - case summary section
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Changed">
- **Before**: The case summary showed "Timer" which displayed the configured timer limit, not when the timer would actually expire.
- **Now**: _The case summary shows "Time Until Limit" which displays the actual deadline timestamp, making it immediately clear when action is required._
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
When managing time-sensitive cases, you need to know *when* you need to act, not just what the configured time limit is. The old "Timer" field was confusing because it didn't tell you the actual deadline. The new "Time Until Limit" field shows you exactly when the timer expires, making it much easier to prioritize your work and ensure you meet deadlines. This is especially critical for compliance-driven workflows where missing a deadline can have serious consequences.
</Accordion>

### üñ±Ô∏è Clickable Custom View Names

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
Custom view names in the "Configure Views" dropdown are now clickable, allowing you to apply a view by simply clicking its name.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Resolve case list page** - "Configure Views" dropdown menu
- **Requires `ConfigurableSummaryBar` feature flag**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Changed">
- **Before**: View names in the Configure Views dropdown were visible but not clickable. You could rearrange them, but clicking them did nothing.
- **Now**: _Click any view name in the dropdown to immediately apply that view and close the dropdown. Hover states and cursor indicators make it clear which items are clickable._
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
This makes switching between custom views much more intuitive. Instead of having to select a view from a different control, you can now click directly on the view name you see in the dropdown. The improved hover states and cursor feedback make the interface feel more responsive and predictable, reducing the mental overhead of managing multiple custom views.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### üíæ Smart Save Filters Button

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
The "Save Filters to View" button now intelligently disables itself when no filter changes have been made, preventing unnecessary save operations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Resolve case list page** - "Configure Views" dropdown when editing a custom view
- **Requires `ConfigurableSummaryBar` feature flag**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Changed">
- **Before**: The "Save Filters to View" button was always enabled, even when you hadn't changed any filters, leading to confusion and unnecessary save attempts.
- **Now**: _The button is disabled (grayed out) when your current filters match the saved view. It only becomes enabled when you actually modify filters._
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
This prevents accidental duplicate saves and makes it immediately clear whether you've made changes that need saving. You won't waste time clicking save when there's nothing to save, and the button state serves as a visual indicator of whether your current view differs from the saved version. It's a small detail that makes the interface feel more polished and intelligent.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### üè∑Ô∏è Product-Specific "All Cases" Views

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
Custom views created for "All Cases" in Eligibility are now completely separate from custom views in Resolve, preventing view confusion across products.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Eligibility > Cases > All Cases** - custom views specific to Eligibility
- **Resolve > Cases > All Cases** - custom views specific to Resolve
- **Requires `ConfigurableSummaryBar` feature flag**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Changed">
- **Before**: Custom views created for "All Cases" in Eligibility would also appear when viewing "All Cases" in Resolve, and vice versa, causing confusion since the products have different workflows and data.
- **Now**: _Each product maintains its own separate set of "All Cases" custom views. Views created in Eligibility stay in Eligibility, and views created in Resolve stay in Resolve._
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
Eligibility and Resolve serve different purposes and have different case management workflows. Mixing their custom views was confusing and could lead to applying inappropriate filters or views. Now, your custom views are properly scoped to the product where they're relevant, making your workflow cleaner and reducing the chance of accidentally using the wrong view for the wrong product.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### üìã Case Activity Feed for Object Links

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
The case activity feed now shows when objects (like Riders or Drivers) are linked to or unlinked from a case, providing complete visibility into case relationships.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Resolve > Case Details > Activity tab**
- **Available in Resolve product only**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What You Can Do">
- See activity feed entries when a Rider, Driver, or other object is linked to the case
- See activity feed entries when objects are unlinked from the case
- Click on the linked object's name to navigate to their detail page
- View who performed the linking/unlinking action and when it occurred
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
Understanding the full history of a case includes knowing which people or entities were involved and when they were added or removed. This audit trail is crucial for case management, compliance, and troubleshooting. If a case was escalated or transferred, you can now see exactly when specific riders or drivers were linked to it, helping you piece together the complete story of what happened and who was involved at each stage.
