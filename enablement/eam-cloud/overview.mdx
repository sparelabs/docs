### Battlecards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="vs Fleetio">
    **Win When**: Transit-specific needs, FTA compliance required, multi-depot operations
    
    **Key Differentiator**: Built specifically for public transit, not adapted from commercial
    
    **Top 3 Advantages**:
    1. ✅ **Transit-specific** - VMRS codes, FTA compliance built-in
    2. ✅ **Facilities management** - Included (Fleetio doesn't have)
    3. ✅ **Government ready** - Procurement friendly, public sector experience
    
    **Their Weakness**: Generic fleet tool trying to serve transit
    
    **🎯 Landmines to Plant**:
    - *"How does it handle FTA reporting requirements?"* - They'll struggle with transit compliance
    - *"Can it manage both fleet AND facilities?"* - They can't; requires separate system
    - *"What's your experience with government procurement?"* - Limited public sector refs
    - *"How do you handle multi-modal operations?"* - Built for trucks, not transit variety

    3. ✅ **Modern mobile app** - Mechanics actually use it
    
    **Their Weakness**: Legacy architecture, slow to deploy
    
    **💰 Pricing Intel**: RTA charges ~$8,500/year for small transit agencies (Duluth Transit example)
    
    **🎯 Landmines to Plant**:
    - *"What's your total implementation timeline?"* - They take 9-12 months minimum
    - *"What infrastructure do we need?"* - Requires on-premise servers, IT staff
