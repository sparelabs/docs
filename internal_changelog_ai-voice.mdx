## ðŸ¤– AI Voice
### ðŸ¤– More Accurate Date Recognition for Rider Authentication

**What's New**  
AI Voice now more rigorously validates date formats during rider authentication. It rejects ambiguous dates like "one one ninety two" (which could mean Jan 1 or Nov 1), while still correctly understanding clear formats like "June 6th 2025" and "2025 06 01".

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- This is a background improvement to the AI Voice rider authentication workflow when a caller provides their date of birth.

#### What You Can Do
- This is an automatic system improvement; no user action is needed. You can expect more reliable authentication outcomes.

#### Why This Matters
This change reduces the chance of authenticating the wrong rider due to ambiguous date understanding. It improves the security and reliability of the AI Voice authentication process by requiring clearer date inputs from callers.
