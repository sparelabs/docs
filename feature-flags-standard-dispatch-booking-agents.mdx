# `AsapDriverBreaks`

**Description:** Allows dispatchers to manually add driver breaks that start as soon as possible (ASAP) rather than at a scheduled future time. When enabled, the "Add Break" modal in the admin interface shows an "ASAP" break option alongside the standard "Later" scheduled break option.

**Why Enable:** Enable for organizations that need flexibility to add unscheduled breaks for drivers who are currently on duty - such as when a driver needs an urgent bathroom break, meal break, or must handle an unexpected situation. The system will insert the break at the earliest feasible time, automatically handling conflicts with scheduled trips by either dropping them off first or rematching them to other drivers.

**Pre-requisites:**
- Duty must be "In Progress" to add ASAP breaks

**Notes:**
- **Temporary/Testing Flag**: This is noted as a rollout/testing feature flag
- **Conflict Resolution**: Supports three modes:
  - (1) None - Shows preview of affected trips
  - (2) AfterDropoffs - Inserts break after current dropoffs, rematches conflicts
  - (3) RematchOnboardRiders - Emergency mode: starts immediately, rematches all affected riders

**Related Feature Flags:** Works independently but is often used alongside:
- `DriverBreaks` - automated break scheduling
- `BreaksWithLocations` - to specify break locations
- `DutyInterruptionReasons` - for break reason management

# `LiveGlobalOptimization`

**Description:** Enables real-time global optimization that continuously re-evaluates and improves driver routes for all active duties, including moving trip assignments between drivers to achieve better overall efficiency.

**Why Enable:** Enable for organizations with high-volume, dynamic demand where real-time route optimization can significantly improve service efficiency. The system will automatically:
- Re-assign trips between drivers when it finds better matches
- Adjust routes as new trips are booked
- Respond to traffic, delays, or cancellations by reoptimizing all affected routes
- Balance workload across drivers for better resource utilization

**Pre-requisites:**
- `EngineV2GlobalOptimization` feature flag must also be enabled
- Organization must be on Engine V2

**Notes:**
- More powerful than basic optimization as it can move trips between drivers (not just optimize individual routes)
- Runs continuously on live/active duties rather than just at duty creation
- Can significantly improve efficiency in high-demand environments
- May result in drivers seeing trip reassignments during their shift
- Should be carefully evaluated for driver experience impact

**Related Feature Flags:** **Required:**
- `EngineV2GlobalOptimization` - must be enabled for this to work
