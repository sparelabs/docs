## üìä Analytics
### üìÖ Configurable Date Filter Time Dimensions

**What's New**  
When creating or editing analytics reports, you can now choose which time dimension (e.g., "Request Created At", "Trip Scheduled At") the primary date filter applies to. This gives you precise control over how date filtering works for each report in both the Report View and on Dashboards.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder*: A new banner at the top of the page displays the current time dimension being used for date filtering. Clicking it reveals a dropdown to select a different dimension.
- *Analytics > Report View*: A tooltip on the date filter now shows which time dimension is being actively filtered.
- *Analytics > Dashboard View*: The global date filter will now respect the specific time dimension configured for each individual report widget on the dashboard.

#### What You Can Do
- Build a report on "Completed Trips" and set the date filter to apply to the "Trip Completion Time" instead of the "Request Creation Time" to accurately analyze trips that finished within a specific period.
- See at a glance which time dimension is driving the date filter for any report, preventing misinterpretation of data.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, date filters were applied to a default time dimension that could not be changed, sometimes leading to inaccurate analysis. Now, you have explicit control to filter reports by the most relevant timestamp, with clear visual indicators to ensure you always know exactly what data you're looking at.
