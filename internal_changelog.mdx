## üéØ Operations
### ‚è±Ô∏è Better Handling for Duty Interruptions

**What's New**  
When creating a duty interruption that is too long to fit before a duty's scheduled end time, the system will now automatically shorten it to the maximum possible duration. You will receive a specific notification indicating that the interruption has been shortened.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Rides > Duties* (when clicking on a duty and using the 'Add Break' modal for an 'Interruption').

#### What You Can Do
- Create a duty interruption near the end of a duty's shift.
- If the interruption is too long, the system will create a shorter one and notify you of the adjusted duration (e.g., "Interruption created but shortened to 15 minutes").
- If no time is available at all, you will receive a clear failure message (e.g., "Could not create interruption as there is not enough time remaining in the duty").

#### Why This Matters
Previously, attempting to create an interruption that couldn't fit on a duty would simply fail without a clear reason. This change improves the workflow by creating a partial interruption when possible and providing clear, actionable feedback to dispatchers.

</Accordion>

---
### üìä Join Case Data with Administrator Details

**What's New**  
A new data relationship has been added in Analytics, allowing you to connect the `Case Data` cube to the `Organization Admin` cube to report on cases by their assigned administrator's details.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (when building a report using the `Case Data` cube).

#### What You Can Do
- Create reports that include details about the administrator assigned to a case. For example, you can now group the total number of open cases by the assignee's first and last name.

#### Why This Matters
Previously, it was not possible to link case data to the administrators they were assigned to, limiting reporting capabilities. This change enables more detailed analysis of case management workloads by allowing you to include assignee information in your reports.
</Accordion>
