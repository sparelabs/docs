## 📊 Analytics
### 📅 Configurable Date Filter Time Dimensions

**What's New**  
When creating or editing analytics reports, you can now choose which time-based field (e.g., "Request Created At", "Trip Scheduled At") the main date filter applies to. This gives you precise control over how date filtering works for each report on your dashboards.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Analytics > Query Builder* (a new "Date Filter Dimension" selector is available in the header, with a banner that clearly displays the currently selected dimension)
- *Analytics > Report View* (a new tooltip on the date filter shows which time dimension is being used for filtering)
- *Analytics > Dashboard View* (dashboard-level date filters will now respect the specific time dimension configured for each individual report widget)

#### What You Can Do
- For any report, select a specific time dimension (like "Duty Started At" or "Request Created At") to be the target of the date filter.
- Build dashboards where different reports respond to the same date filter in different ways (e.g., one report shows trips created that day, while another shows trips scheduled for that day).

#### Why This Matters
Previously, date filters always applied to a default time dimension, which could make it difficult to analyze data based on other important timestamps like scheduled times or completion times. Now, you have explicit control to filter reports by the exact time dimension that matters for your analysis, ensuring greater accuracy and flexibility.
</Accordion>

</Accordion>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Live Requests Custom Column Ordering**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed an issue in the *Rides > Live Requests* table where hiding and then re-showing a column would cause it to move to the end of the table. Columns now return to their original configured position when they are made visible again.

---

## ⚙️ Admin
### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **API Pagination Handling (BUS-4248)**

  ## 🎯 Operations

  ### ⏱️ Smarter Scheduling for Duty Interruptions

  **What's New**\
  When creating a duty interruption (like a driver break), the system is now smarter about fitting it into the schedule. If the requested duration is too long (e.g., it extends past the duty's end time), the system will automatically create a shorter interruption that fits and notify you of the adjustment.

  **Pre-requisites**

  - Requires Administrator access

  <Accordion title="See More">
    #### Where You'll See It

    - _Operations \> Duties \> (select a duty) \> Driver Breaks tab \> 'Add Break' button_

    #### What You Can Do

    - Create an immediate duty interruption for a driver. If the duty is ending soon and cannot accommodate the full interruption length, a shorter, valid interruption will be created instead. You will see a message confirming the adjusted length.

    #### Why This Matters

    This prevents failures when trying to add breaks near the end of a duty. Instead of an error, the system now finds the maximum possible duration, improving flexibility for dispatchers managing last-minute schedule changes.
  </Accordion>
  ---

  ### 🐛 Bug Fixes

  - **Service Estimates Zone Validation (BUS-3786)**
    - _Resolution_: Corrected an issue where a service might not appear as an option during trip estimation if the location was in an area with time-based service gaps. The system now validates geography first for estimates, and applies time-based rules only after a specific trip time is selected for booking.

  <Accordion title="See More">
    #### Where You'll See It

    - _Analytics \> Query Builder_ (new dimensions available under the `Group Membership` cube)

    #### What You Can Do

    - Build reports that filter or group by custom fields on group memberships, such as `adaCode` or `disability`, without needing to join through the ridership report.

    #### Why This Matters

    Previously, these custom fields were only accessible indirectly. This change provides direct access, simplifying report creation and enabling more powerful queries on group membership details.
  </Accordion>
  ---

  **Pre-requisites**

  - Requires `AnalyticsV2` feature flag
  - Requires Administrator access

  <Accordion title="See More">
    #### Where You'll See It

    - _Analytics \> Query Builder_

    #### What You Can Do

    - When building a report based on `Case Data`, you can now add dimensions from the `Organization Admin` cube, such as the first and last name of the case assignee.

    #### Why This Matters

    Previously, it was not possible to join these two data sets, making it difficult to report on which administrators were assigned to which cases. This change enables direct reporting on case assignments and admin workloads.
  </Accordion>
  ---

  ### 🐛 Bug Fixes

  - **Ridership Report Payment Method Capture (BUS-4303)**
    - _Resolution_: Fixed an issue in the Analytics V2 Ridership Report where the `payment_method_type_name` was not being correctly captured for cash or ticket-based payments. These payment types will now appear correctly in reports.

  **Pre-requisites**

  - No feature flags required

  <Accordion title="See More">
    #### Where You'll See It

    - This applies to any AI Voice workflow that requires rider authentication via date of birth.

    #### What You Can Do

    - Riders can state their date of birth in formats like "June 6th 2025" or "2025 06 01," and the system will understand it correctly. Ambiguous dates like "one one ninety two" (which could be January 1st or November 1st) will be rejected, prompting the caller for a clearer response.

    #### Why This Matters

    This change improves the reliability of rider authentication over the phone. By correctly understanding unambiguous dates and asking for clarification on ambiguous ones, the system reduces failed authentications and improves the caller experience.
  </Accordion>

  The interface for managing multimodal graphs has been completely redesigned and is now integrated directly into each organization's settings page, providing a more intuitive and error-proof workflow.

  **Pre-requisites**

  - Requires Super admin permissions

  <Accordion title="See More">
    #### Where You'll See It

    - _Super Admin \> Organizations \> (select an organization) \> Multimodal Configuration tab_

    #### What You Can Do

    - View the build status of the current graph, request a rebuild with a single click, and manage all associated datasets (GTFS, Flex, OpenStreetMap) in a context-aware interface that only shows datasets relevant to the selected organization.

    #### Why This Matters

    The previous graph management UI was complex and made it easy to make mistakes, like assigning a dataset to the wrong organization. This new, streamlined workflow is organized by organization, significantly reducing the risk of configuration errors and making graph management much more intuitive.
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
  ---

  ### 🖼️ Streamlined Profile Photo Management

  **What's New**\
  To improve security and streamline the interface, all photo URLs for administrators and drivers are now secure, short-lived links. Additionally, the 'Photo' column has been removed from the main list views for Drivers and Administrators.

  **Pre-requisites**

  - Requires Administrator access

  <Accordion title="See More">
    #### Where You'll See It

    - _People \> Drivers_ (list view)
    - _People \> Administrators_ (list view)

    #### What You Can Do

    - You can still view, add, or update photos by clicking into an individual driver's or administrator's profile. The main list views are now cleaner and load faster without the photo previews.

    #### Why This Matters

    This change enhances data security by preventing direct, permanent access to photo URLs. Removing the column from list views provides a more consistent user experience across different user types (Riders, Drivers, Admins).
  </Accordion>
