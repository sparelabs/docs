### ‚è±Ô∏è Prolonged Duration Column and Sorting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
Request lists now include a "Prolonged Duration" column that shows how long a rider has been in the vehicle beyond their expected trip duration, with the ability to sort by this metric.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Rides > Live Requests** - new sortable column in request table
- **Rides > Late Requests** - new sortable column in request table
- **No feature flags required**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What You Can Do">
- View the prolonged duration for each request directly in the request list
- Sort requests by prolonged duration to quickly identify trips where riders have been in vehicles the longest
- Use this metric to prioritize interventions for riders experiencing extended travel times
- The value is calculated by the backend for accuracy and consistency
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
Maximum time in vehicle is a critical metric for service quality and compliance. When riders spend significantly longer in a vehicle than expected, it impacts their experience and can violate service standards. Previously, you couldn't easily see which riders were experiencing the longest delays. Now, you can sort by prolonged duration to immediately identify the most urgent situations and take action. This is especially important for paratransit services where time-in-vehicle limits are often regulatory requirements. The sortable column makes it easy to monitor this metric across all active trips and respond to issues proactively.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Prolonged Ride Duration Tracking

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
The system now tracks and displays when rides exceed their expected travel duration, showing "excess detour" time in the request timeline and adding a "Prolonged Duration" column to request lists.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **Rides > Live Requests** - new "Prolonged Duration" column in request table
- **Request details > Timeline** - red badge showing "X min excess detour" for prolonged rides
- **Analytics** - new `prolongedRequestCount` metric in daily request counts API
- **No feature flags required**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What You Can Do">
- See at a glance which rides are taking longer than expected in the request table
- View excess detour time directly in the request timeline with visual indicators
- Filter requests by `isProlonged` to focus on trips exceeding expected duration
- Track prolonged ride counts in analytics, grouped by hour, service, fleet, or driver
- For in-progress rides, see real-time updates as the prolonged duration increases
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
Maximum time in vehicle is a critical service quality metric and often a regulatory requirement for paratransit services. When riders spend significantly longer in vehicles than expected (travel duration + flexibility buffer), it impacts their experience and can violate service standards. Previously, identifying these situations required manual calculation and monitoring. Now, the system automatically flags prolonged rides with clear visual indicators, making it easy to spot issues as they happen. The red badge in the timeline immediately draws attention to problems, and the sortable column lets you prioritize interventions. Real-time tracking for in-progress rides means you can take action before a ride becomes excessively prolonged, improving service quality and compliance.

### üîç Filter Requests by Trip Group

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's New">
You can now filter requests by trip group ID, making it possible to see all requests associated with a specific recurring trip group.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where You'll See It">
- **API endpoint** - new `tripGroupId` query parameter on the requests endpoint
- Backend support for the Requests Display on Trip Group Details feature
- **No feature flags required** - available with recurring trips access
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What You Can Do">
- Query the requests API with a `tripGroupId` parameter to get only requests belonging to that trip group
- Filter results respect trip group direction (inbound/outbound)
- This enables the frontend to display requests on trip group detail pages
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why This Matters">
This is the backend foundation that powers the ability to view all requests within a trip group (released on October 9th). By enabling efficient filtering by trip group, the system can quickly show you all the individual ride requests that are part of a recurring group schedule, making it much easier to manage and troubleshoot recurring trip patterns.
