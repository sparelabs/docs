## ‚öôÔ∏è Admin
### ‚úàÔ∏è New Cross-Region Data Migration Tool

**What's New**  
A completely redesigned Data Migration Tool (DMT) is now available for Super Admins. This new interface is specifically built to support migrating data for an organization from a source region (e.g., North America) to a destination region (e.g., Europe).

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Super Admin sidebar > Data Migrations*

#### What You Can Do
- Select a source and destination region from dropdown menus.
- Choose the source and destination organizations for the migration.
- Select specific data items to migrate (e.g., Services, Zones, Rider Groups).
- View real-time results of the migration process, with success or failure details for each item.

#### Why This Matters
This tool provides a robust, purpose-built solution for onboarding new organizations or restructuring existing ones across Spare's global infrastructure. It gives Super Admins granular control and clear feedback during complex cross-region data transfers.

### üó∫Ô∏è New Organization-Level Multimodal Graph Configuration

**What's New**  
The configuration for multimodal graphs, which power public transit journey planning, has been redesigned and integrated directly into the organization details page. This new interface filters all datasets to the current organization, simplifying management and reducing errors.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Super admin permissions

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Super Admin > Organizations* (select an organization to see the new "Multimodal Configuration" section).

#### What You Can Do
- View the build status of the current graph and see when it was last updated.
- Trigger a graph rebuild directly from the UI using the "Request Rebuild" button.
- Manage all datasets (like GTFS feeds or flex routes) for the organization's graph in one place.
- When configuring a flex dataset, select from a list of services belonging only to that organization, preventing misconfiguration.

#### Why This Matters
The previous graph configuration UI was global, making it difficult to manage datasets for a specific organization. This new, organization-centric workflow is more intuitive, reduces the risk of errors, and provides clear visibility into the status of an organization's transit data graph.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Set a Default Country for Your Organization

**What's New**  
You can now set a "Default Country" for your organization. This country's flag and phone prefix will automatically appear in phone number input fields, such as when adding a new rider.

**Pre-requisites**
- Requires Administrator access to change the setting. Super Admins can set this when creating or editing an organization.

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- **Setting**: *Settings > Organization > General* (new "Default Country" dropdown field).
- **Effect**: *Riders > All Riders* (click "New Rider" to see the "Phone Number" field).

#### What You Can Do
- Navigate to your organization settings to select a default country.
- When creating new riders, the phone number field will default to your chosen country, simplifying data entry for staff.

#### Why This Matters
This helps reduce data entry errors and saves time for administrators by pre-filling the most common country code for your operations.

### üîí Secure Photo URLs and Updated User Lists

**What's New**  
To enhance data security, the "Photo" column has been removed from the main list views for both Drivers and Administrators. Profile photos remain accessible on individual user profiles, where they are now served via secure, temporary URLs.

**Pre-requisites**
- No feature flags required

<Accordion title="See More">

#### Where You'll See It
- *Team > Drivers* (the "Photo" column is no longer present in the table).
- *Team > Administrators* (the "Photo" column is no longer present in the table).

#### What You Can Do
- This is an automatic security improvement. You can continue to view and manage user photos by navigating to their individual profile pages.

#### Why This Matters
This change aligns Driver and Administrator data handling with the security standards already in place for Riders. By removing permanent photo URLs from list views, it enhances user privacy and overall platform security.
</Accordion>

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Improved Service Estimates Zone Validation (BUS-3786)**
  * _Resolution_: Fixed an issue where some services would not appear as available during the initial service estimate lookup. The system now validates location against service zones first, and only validates against time rules after a specific trip time has been selected.
