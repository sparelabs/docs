## Description

You can now use the @ shortcut (or button), to search and mention Spare entities (e.g. riders, services, drivers etc...) when using Scout.

## Why is this needed

This makes applying filters to analytics charts a lot quicker and easier, something which was slightly challenging previously. You no longer have to remember the exact name of the entity you want to filter by, now you can just type @ then search for it.
