# `Multimodal`

**Description:** Enables multimodal trip planning functionality in the rider app, allowing riders to book journeys that combine on-demand rides with public transit (buses, trains, ferries, etc.). The rider app displays integrated trip options showing both transit legs and on-demand connections.

**Why Enable:** Enable for organizations operating in areas with public transit infrastructure who want to offer riders seamless door-to-door journeys that combine their on-demand service with existing transit options. This is ideal for first-mile/last-mile connections (e.g., on-demand ride to the train station, then train to destination) or for giving riders more travel options when direct on-demand service isn't available or is more expensive.

**Pre-requisites:**
- GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) feeds must be configured for the region's public transit systems
- Open Trip Planner integration must be set up to process transit routing

**Notes:**
- GTFS feeds are standardized data feeds that contain public transit schedules, routes, stops, and real-time information
- Requires backend configuration to connect to transit data sources
- Riders see trip options that may include: walk to bus stop, take bus, transfer to train, on-demand ride for final mile
- Trip costs show combined pricing for on-demand portions plus transit fares

**Related Feature Flags:** Works independently but can be used alongside:
- `RiderGtfsScheduleViewer` - allows riders to view GTFS transit schedules
- `MultimodalTransitHubs` - enables labeling stops as transit hubs for better routing

# `Tickets`

**Description:** Enables the ticket payment method type, allowing riders to purchase and use digital tickets (day passes, multi-ride passes, etc.) as a payment method for trips. Admins can configure various ticket options with different durations, rider limits, and pricing.

**Why Enable:** Enable for transit agencies or organizations that want to sell passes or multi-use tickets to riders. Common use cases include:
- Day passes (unlimited rides for 24 hours)
- Multi-ride tickets (10-ride packs)
- Weekly/monthly passes
- Special event passes
- Student or senior discount tickets

**Pre-requisites:**
- Ticket Payment Method Type must be configured in the admin panel with ticket options, pricing, and expiry rules

**Notes:**
- Riders can purchase tickets through the rider app using their wallet or payment method
- Admins can also grant tickets to riders for free
- Ticket instances track usage (number of rides remaining) and expiration
- Tickets can be configured with various options: single-use, time-based, or ride-count based
- Different ticket types can have different pricing for different rider categories

**Related Feature Flags:** Works independently but is often used alongside:
- `Wallet` - riders can use wallet balance to purchase tickets
- `FarePasses` - another type of payment pass system

# `RiderGtfsScheduleViewer`

**Description:** Enables a GTFS schedule viewer on the rider app home screen, allowing riders to browse public transit schedules, routes, and stops directly in the app without booking a trip.

**Why Enable:** Enable for organizations with multimodal services where riders benefit from browsing transit schedules before deciding how to travel. This is particularly useful in areas with robust public transit where riders might want to:
- Check bus/train schedules before planning their trip
- See which transit routes serve their area
- View stop locations and service frequencies
- Plan trips combining transit and on-demand service

**Pre-requisites:**
- GTFS feeds must be configured for the region
- Multimodal functionality should typically be enabled

**Notes:**
- Provides informational transit schedule viewing separate from booking functionality
- Riders can explore transit options without committing to a trip
- Helps riders make informed decisions about whether to use transit, on-demand, or multimodal combinations
- Display shows real-time schedule information when available in GTFS feeds

**Related Feature Flags:** Works independently but is typically used alongside:
- `Multimodal` - enables booking multimodal journeys
- `Tickets` - allows purchasing transit passes

# `MultimodalDoNotBiasCostsTowardsRequested`

**Description:** Disables cost bias toward the requested departure/arrival time in multimodal journey planning. When disabled (default), the system prefers journeys closer to the requested time even if they cost slightly more. When enabled, the system treats all times equally and may suggest cheaper options that depart significantly earlier or later.

**Why Enable:** Enable for cost-sensitive organizations where finding the cheapest journey is more important than departing/arriving close to the rider's requested time. This is useful when:
- Riders prioritize saving money over convenience
- Service operates in price-competitive markets
- Organization wants to maximize transit usage (typically cheaper than on-demand)

**Pre-requisites:**
- `Multimodal` must be enabled

**Notes:**
- This is a fine-tuning parameter for multimodal journey search behavior
- Default behavior (flag disabled) balances cost and convenience
- When enabled, riders may see journeys that are cheapest but depart hours before/after requested time
- Consider rider feedback before enabling as it may reduce user experience

**Related Feature Flags:** **Required:**
- `Multimodal` - must be enabled for multimodal functionality

# `MultimodalSearchV3`

**Description:** Uses a new pagination strategy (V3) for finding journey options from Open Trip Planner in multimodal searches, improving the search algorithm's efficiency and result quality.

**Why Enable:** Enable for organizations experiencing issues with multimodal search performance or quality. The V3 algorithm provides:
- Improved search efficiency
- Better journey option diversity
- More reliable pagination of results
- Reduced API calls to Open Trip Planner

**Pre-requisites:**
- `Multimodal` must be enabled

**Notes:**
- This is a technical improvement to the multimodal search engine
- V3 represents the latest pagination strategy for journey finding
- Should generally be enabled for better performance unless specifically troubleshooting issues
- Changes how the system queries Open Trip Planner but not what results are shown to riders

**Related Feature Flags:** **Required:**
- `Multimodal` - must be enabled for multimodal functionality

# `MultimodalSearchReducedFinalSweep`

**Description:** Reduces the final sweep duration in multimodal search from 6 hours to 3 hours. The final sweep is an extended search phase that looks for additional journey options beyond the initial quick results.

**Why Enable:** Enable for organizations that want faster multimodal search responses and are willing to trade comprehensiveness for speed. This is useful when:
- Search response time is more important than finding every possible option
- Riders typically book trips within a 3-hour window of their requested time
- System load is high and reducing search duration improves overall performance

**Pre-requisites:**
- `Multimodal` must be enabled

**Notes:**
- Default behavior searches for up to 6 hours to find comprehensive journey options
- Enabling reduces to 3 hours, improving response time but may miss some options
- Consider rider booking patterns before enabling
- Mutually exclusive with `MultimodalSearchDisableFinalSweep` (use one or the other, not both)

**Related Feature Flags:** **Required:**
- `Multimodal` - must be enabled for multimodal functionality

**Alternative:**
- `MultimodalSearchDisableFinalSweep` - completely disables final sweep (fastest but least comprehensive)

---

# `MultimodalSearchDisableFinalSweep`

**Description:** Completely disables the final sweep phase in multimodal search. When enabled, the system only returns initial quick results without performing extended searching for additional journey options.

**Why Enable:** Enable for organizations that prioritize fastest possible search response time over journey option diversity. This provides maximum performance improvement but may significantly reduce the number of journey options shown to riders. Consider when:
- System is under heavy load
- Response time is critical (e.g., high-volume booking periods)
- Initial results are typically sufficient for most riders

**Pre-requisites:**
- `Multimodal` must be enabled

**Notes:**
- Provides fastest search response time but least comprehensive results
- Riders will see fewer journey options compared to default behavior
- May impact rider satisfaction if they don't see their preferred options
- Most aggressive performance optimization option
- Mutually exclusive with `MultimodalSearchReducedFinalSweep` (use one or the other, not both)

**Related Feature Flags:** **Required:**
- `Multimodal` - must be enabled for multimodal functionality

**Alternative:**
- `MultimodalSearchReducedFinalSweep` - reduces (but doesn't eliminate) final sweep duration

# `MultimodalFilterServicesByGraph`

**Description:** When converting walking legs to on-demand service in multimodal journeys, only considers on-demand services that are attached to the multimodal graph via flex datasets. This ensures better integration between transit and on-demand portions.

**Why Enable:** Enable for organizations with complex service configurations where not all on-demand services should be offered for multimodal connections. This ensures:
- Only appropriate services are used for first-mile/last-mile connections
- Services are properly configured for multimodal integration
- Better control over which fleets handle multimodal vs. standalone trips

**Pre-requisites:**
- `Multimodal` must be enabled
- Services must be properly configured with flex datasets in the multimodal graph

**Notes:**
- This is a technical filtering mechanism for service selection in multimodal contexts
- Without this flag, any available on-demand service might be offered for multimodal connections
- Ensures services used for multimodal legs are specifically configured for that purpose
- Requires proper setup of flex datasets in the multimodal configuration

**Related Feature Flags:** **Required:**
- `Multimodal` - must be enabled for multimodal functionality
