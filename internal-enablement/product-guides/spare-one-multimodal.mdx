# What is Spare One?

## 📱 What is Spare One — and How is It different from the Rider App?

<Info>
Spare One is the next evolution of the Rider App. It brings together microtransit, paratransit, and fixed-route services into one connected experience—giving agencies a powerful tool to reduce missed connections, deliver better service, and maintain brand control.
</Info>

The Rider App today lets riders easily book microtransit and paratransit trips. **Spare One builds on that foundation** — transforming the Rider App into a **complete mobility platform** that supports every part of a rider's journey.

With Spare One, agencies unlock **Multimodal support**, meaning riders are no longer limited to one service type. Instead, Spare weaves together multiple modes — microtransit pickups, fixed-route buses and trains, last-mile microtransit — into one continuous, reliable trip.

## Key upgrades with Spare One:

- **One app** for planning, booking, and paying — across on-demand and fixed-route services. Riders don't have to switch apps or channels.
- **Smarter trip planning** that connects services automatically, reducing missed connections.
- **Multiple rider communication channels** – Share announcements with riders directly in the app and customize them based on level of urgency. In addition, add custom help and contact links so that riders can stay informed about how your service operates.
- **Agency-first branding and communications** — your app stays in your control, not a third party's. Other solutions maintain control of branding and updates—Spare puts it back in your hands.

<Warning>
**Bottom Line**: Spare One upgrades the rider app experience into a full-service mobility solution, enabling riders to book trips across multiple modes — without requiring riders to download another app. Agencies simply unlock a branded and better experience for every rider and every trip.
</Warning>

## 💜 Spare One benefits for agencies and riders

### 🚐 Why agencies love it
- **More complete trips** = more satisfied riders
- **Better use of services** = higher ridership, smarter operations
- **Stronger relationships** = direct communication through your branded app
- **Future-ready** = Dynamic Rebooking keeps trips moving, even when things change (coming soon)

### 🧑🏾‍🦼🧍🏾‍♀️ Why Riders love it

When a rider misses a bus connection and waits 30 minutes — or worse, misses their next leg entirely — it's more than just an inconvenience. It's a breakdown of trust.

**For riders, missed connections mean:**
- **Lost time** they can't get back — late for work, school, or important appointments.
- **Stress and uncertainty** — wondering if the system will ever get them where they need to go.
- **A feeling of being stuck** — especially for those who depend on transit with no other options.
- **Loss of confidence** in public transit — leading them to look for alternatives, if they can.

**With Spare One, riders get:**
- A single, end-to-end trip plan that connects every mode
- Updates when things change
- No guesswork, no long waits, no app juggling

When riders trust the system, they keep coming back.

## 🏅 Proof points: How agencies are using Spare One today

| Agency | Challenge | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Met Council (Minneapolis, MN)** | Riders needed better first-mile/last-mile connections across a sprawling metro area. | With Spare One and Multimodal, Met Council connected microtransit to major fixed routes — reducing wait times and boosting trip completion. [**Full case study here**](https://spare.com/customer-stories/metro-transit-multimodal-microtransit) |
| **The HOP (Hill Country, Texas)** | Rural riders faced long distances and few fixed routes, making full trips hard to complete. | Multimodal planning let The HOP seamlessly connect microtransit pickups with local transit options, cutting travel times dramatically. [**Full case study here**](https://spare.com/customer-stories/the-hop-microtransit-expansion-central-texas) |
| **LA Metro (Coming Soon)** | Needed true multimodal coordination for one of the largest, most complex systems in North America. | LA Metro is partnering with Spare to deliver a full multimodal rider experience — a major competitive win against RideCo and Via. |

## 🥊 How Spare One stacks up against competitors

As Spare evolves into rider-facing multimodal trip planning, we're entering a broader arena that includes both traditional competitors and rider-first apps. But Spare One isn't just another trip planner—it's a platform tailored for public transit agencies, focused on performance, flexibility, and rider communication.

### How Spare competes with RideCo's "Time Snapping"

The intention behind RideCo's Time Snapping feature is to ensure connections between on demand and fixed route services go seamlessly. Spare has been focused on this problem and tackles it with:

Spare's **"Arrive By" feature** is built directly into our multimodal trip planning engine — ensuring riders reach their final destination and each individual connection on time.

While RideCo promotes "Time Snapping" to align trips with fixed-route schedules, Spare goes further:
- Every leg of a journey is automatically "Time Snapped" using Spare's "Arrive By" feature.
- This means Spare prioritizes getting riders to transfer points exactly when they need to — no guessing, no long waits.
- **Dynamic Rebooking (coming soon):** If a rider's journey gets disrupted, Spare will rebook the trip mid-journey to keep them on track.

### How Spare competes with Via/citymapper: The branding tradeoff

Via acquired Citymapper to enable multimodal trip planning. But that comes at a cost:
- No white-labeling: your brand disappears from the app store
- Rider comms are owned by Via
- Works best only with Via-powered services

With Spare One, the app is yours. Your brand. Your experience. Your control.
