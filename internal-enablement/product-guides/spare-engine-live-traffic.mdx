# Spare AI Engine

<Info>
Spare Engine is the dynamic optimization brain behind every trip. It reacts instantly to real-world disruptions by reshuffling driver manifests in near real-time, using live Google traffic data through an first and only integration with Google for intelligent, real-time rerouting. With turn-by-turn Google Maps navigation delivered directly to drivers, Spare Engine eliminates manual intervention and guesswork‚Äîit's simply smarter transit.

# What is Google Live Traffic?

<Info>
**Google Live Traffic** is about to be fully integrated across the Spare Platform‚Äîenhancing both the **Driver App** experience and the **Spare Engine's optimization logic** with real-time road data.

In the **Driver App tablets**, drivers will receive **turn-by-turn navigation powered by Google Maps**, automatically adapting to road closures, accidents, and congestion‚Äîeliminating the need for third-party navigation tools. Behind the scenes, the **Spare Engine will begin leveraging live Google traffic data to create and re-optimize driver manifests every minute with more accurate travel durations**, ensuring more intelligent, real-time trip reshuffling that accounts for actual road conditions.

The result? Fewer delays. Smarter assignments. And a dramatically improved experience for drivers, dispatchers, and riders alike.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FAQ

### What is the Google Live Traffic integration in Spare?

This is a powerful new capability leveraging Google's dynamic, real-time traffic data to enhance our platform. It's being rolled out in two phases:

- **Phase 1 (Live & Currently Being Tested):** **Google Maps navigation and live traffic data directly within the Spare Driver App.** This provides drivers with intuitive, up-to-the-minute directions that account for current road conditions.
- **Phase 2 (Rolling Out Soon for Testing):** **Google Maps live traffic data integrated directly into the Spare Engine for routing optimization.** This will allow our AI to proactively adjust routes, manage schedules, and optimize trips based on real-time traffic conditions, moving beyond historical predictions.

### When is Google Live Traffic available to customers?

Phase 1 (Driver App navigation) is already live and being actively tested with North American customers. Phase 2 (Engine integration) will begin rolling out at the end of Q3 to select customers for testing, with General Availability (GA) to all customers expected once Phase 2 is fully stable and ready for widespread deployment.

### What's new in Spare Engine in S'S '25 keynote?

1. **Targeted optimization: Recurring trip groups**
   - Agencies can now predefine recurring trip cohorts (e.g. riders going to senior centers, dialysis, or day programs).
   - Spare AI dynamically optimizes these groupings day-to-day without manual intervention or rigid schedule templates.
   - Riders benefit from consistent vehicle and driver assignment; agencies benefit from reduced vehicle hours and improved pooling efficiency.

2. **Automatic overrides: Smart disruption handling**
   - In response to real-world service disruptions (driver callouts, vehicle breakdowns), Spare AI makes intelligent reassignments in real time.
   - Prioritizes minimizing lateness and violation risks rather than simply reassigning to the nearest vehicle.
   - Early adopters have seen up to **30% reduction in overall lateness** and measurable decreases in rider complaints and on-board time violations.

3. **Fixed Route Detour: Paratransit time limits**
   - Spare AI now enforces a new compliance rule: paratransit trips cannot exceed the duration of their fixed-route equivalent.
   - Eliminates the need for agencies to manually audit trips for ADA compliance.
   - Provides riders with equitable service levels and simplifies agency reporting workflows.

4. **DSP/NDSP optimization: real-time rebalancing**
   - Spare now continuously monitors trip execution and reassigns eligible rides from dedicated to non-dedicated partners (e.g. Uber, Lyft, taxi) when delays emerge.
   - Supports custom agency policies and budget thresholds for NDSP usage.
   - Reduces dispatcher workload while maintaining service punctuality and rider trust.

### How does this new integration with Google connect to the bigger picture?

Our partnership with Google and the approach we've chosen to bring true Google powered live traffic into *both* the routing engine and the driver app experience will help make paratransit more reliable for riders, boost on-time performance and increase vehicle productivity. This decision plays a key part of Spare's vision to build a connected, AI-powered transit system that helps agencies **do more with less, and do it in a cost-effective way.**

It also advances key priorities:
- Proactive dispatch operations
- Regulatory automation
- Human-in-the-loop dispatch support

### How is Spare's Google Live Traffic integration different from what customers might already think they have?

It's important to educate customers on the depth of our integration:

- **Not just an external hyperlink:** Some competitors simply link drivers out to external mapping apps, which isn't integrated into the core workflow or data.
- **More than just an admin panel view:** Other solutions might show traffic visuals (green/yellow/red) in a dispatcher's admin panel. While helpful, this often still requires manual intervention or "mental math" for dispatchers and drivers, creating inefficiencies.
- **Spare's differentiation:** Our integration is unique because it brings dynamic, real-time Google traffic data directly into **both the driver app (for live navigation)** AND, critically, into **our routing engine so that Driver manifests are created and optimized based on the real time traffic data**. This provides truly intelligent, proactive routing and a seamless experience for both dispatchers and drivers.

### What is the pricing strategy for Google Live Traffic for existing customers?

For all *current* Spare accounts, we are providing the Google Live Traffic integration with a **100% discount** for the upcoming term. This is a strategic investment on our part to drive adoption, gather vital feedback, and secure mutual value.

### Why are we offering a 100% discount? What's the catch?

There's no catch. This 100% discount is offered in exchange for a partnership that demonstrates the value and impact of this new capability. Specifically, we are asking customers to collaborate on one or more of the following:

- **Providing a Reference:** Be a vocal advocate for Spare to prospective customers.
- **Developing a Case Study:** Work with our marketing team to showcase the operational efficiencies and rider experience improvements achieved.
- **Considering an Early Renewal:** Align their contract term with this significant platform advancement.
- **Opportunity to Co-Present:** Present together at an industry conference or webinar about their success with the integration.
