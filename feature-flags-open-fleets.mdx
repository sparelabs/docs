# `OpenFleet`

**Description:** Enables integration with external fleet providers (like Uzurv, Lyft, Uber, and other third-party operators), allowing the system to route trip requests to these external services when appropriate and track their fulfillment.

**Why Enable:** Enable for organizations that want to extend capacity beyond their own fleet by partnering with external providers. This is valuable when:
- Demand exceeds available in-house fleet capacity
- Service area extends beyond where your fleet operates
- Cost-effective to outsource certain trips to third-party providers
- Need to provide service 24/7 but don't have round-the-clock fleet availability

**Pre-requisites:**
- External fleet provider integrations must be configured and active
- Business agreements with external providers must be in place

**Notes:**
- Requests can be automatically routed to external fleets based on availability, cost, or policy rules
- System tracks trip status even when fulfilled by external providers
- Billing and reconciliation with external providers must be managed
- Useful for hybrid models combining owned fleet with on-demand marketplace capacity

**Related Feature Flags:** Works independently but is often used alongside:
- `OpenFleetRematching` - enables rematching trips to/from external fleets
