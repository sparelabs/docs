# Spare Standard - Dispatch & Booking Agents

# `LiveMessagesNotificationSound`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Dispatch & Booking Agents

**Description:** Enables an audible notification sound in the admin panel whenever a new message is received in the Live Messages chat.

**Why Enable:** This provides an immediate, audible alert to dispatchers when a driver sends a message. For a busy dispatcher who may not be looking at the Live Messages screen at all times, this sound ensures that they are aware of new messages and can respond promptly. It's a simple but effective way to improve the responsiveness of dispatch-to-driver communication.

**Pre-requisites:**
- The `DriverDispatchCommunication` feature flag (which enables Live Messages) must be enabled.

**Notes:**
- The sound is played in the browser, so the user's computer must have sound enabled.

**Related Feature Flags:**
- **Requires:** `DriverDispatchCommunication`

# `LockToDuty`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Dispatch & Booking Agents

**Description:** Allows a dispatcher or booking agent to "lock" or "pin" a specific trip request to a specific duty. This overrides the normal matching engine and forces the trip to be assigned to the selected duty.

**Why Enable:** This provides a manual override for the matching engine, which is essential for handling exceptions and special cases. For example, if a specific rider has requested a specific driver, or if a trip requires a specific vehicle (e.g., one with a wheelchair lift), this feature allows the dispatcher to manually ensure the correct assignment.

**Pre-requisites:**
- The user must have the appropriate permissions to lock a request to a duty.

**Notes:**
- This should be used judiciously, as it overrides the automated optimization engine.

# `ConstraintOverrides`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Dispatch & Booking Agents

**Description:** Enables a powerful feature for dispatchers that allows them to "force" a trip into the schedule, even if it violates certain constraints (like the rider's desired pickup window or the driver's duty end time). The system will show the "cost" or impact of the override (e.g., how late it will make other trips).

**Why Enable:** This is an essential tool for handling the realities of day-of operations. When unexpected events occur (like a vehicle breaking down or a rider having an emergency), this feature gives dispatchers the flexibility to make manual adjustments to the schedule to accommodate the situation, while still understanding the downstream consequences of their actions.

**Pre-requisites:**
- None.

**Notes:**
- This is an advanced dispatcher tool that provides a great deal of power and flexibility.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `ForceMatch`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Dispatch & Booking Agents

**Description:** Allows a dispatcher to manually force a request onto a duty, bypassing the normal matching constraints and validations. This is a more direct and powerful version of `LockToDuty`.

**Why Enable:** This is an "escape hatch" for dispatchers when they need to make a match that the system would normally prevent. It provides a way to override the system's rules in exceptional circumstances.

**Pre-requisites:**
- The user must have the appropriate permissions.

**Notes:**
- This is a very powerful tool that should be used with extreme caution, as it can result in a schedule that is inefficient or even impossible to execute.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `ManualInterventions`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Standard - Dispatch & Booking Agents

**Description:** Enables a suite of tools that allow dispatchers to manually correct the state of a trip in real-time. This includes actions like reversing a "no-show," reversing a pickup or dropoff, and editing the completed time of a pickup or dropoff.

**Why Enable:** This is essential for maintaining accurate data and correcting common operational errors. For example, if a driver accidentally marks a rider as a "no-show," a dispatcher can use this feature to reverse that action and put the trip back on the schedule. This ensures that the system's data accurately reflects what is happening in the real world.

**Pre-requisites:**
- None.

**Notes:**
- This is a key set of tools for day-to-day dispatch operations.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.
