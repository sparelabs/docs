# `EngageAIScan`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Eligibility Platform

**Description:** Adds an AI-powered document scanning feature within Spare Engage. Users can upload an image of a form or document (e.g., an eligibility application), and the system will use AI to automatically extract and populate the data into the corresponding fields in a case form.

**Why Enable:** This feature dramatically speeds up the data entry process for paper-based workflows and reduces manual errors. Instead of typing out information from a physical document, agents can simply scan it. This is ideal for organizations that process a high volume of paper applications or need to digitize historical records.

**Pre-requisites:**
- The organization must be using Spare Engage for case management.

**Notes:**
- This feature is accessible from within a case form, where an agent can initiate the scan and review the extracted data before saving.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `EngageAIVoice`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Eligibility Platform

**Description:** Enables an AI Voice agent specifically for the Spare Engage product. This allows riders or applicants to call in and interact with a voice assistant to complete eligibility applications, check the status of their case, or provide required information.

**Why Enable:** Provides a convenient, automated channel for eligibility and case management tasks, reducing the need for live agent intervention for routine inquiries. This is valuable for organizations that want to offer 24/7 access to case information and reduce the administrative burden on their staff.

**Pre-requisites:**
- Requires a configured Twilio account and phone number set up for voice calls.
- The organization must be using Spare Engage.

**Notes:**
- The voice agent's skills can be customized to handle specific workflows related to the organization's eligibility processes.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently but is often used alongside other Engage features.

# `CaseSummary`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Eligibility Platform

**Description:** Enables an AI-powered summary feature at the top of the Case Activity Feed in Spare Engage. It automatically generates a concise, high-level summary of the case based on all the notes, events, and forms within it.

**Why Enable:** Saves agents significant time by providing an "at-a-glance" overview of a case's history and current status. Instead of reading through potentially dozens of entries in the activity feed, an agent can get the key information instantly. This is especially useful for complex cases or when an agent is taking over a case from a colleague.

**Pre-requisites:**
- The organization must be using Spare Engage.

**Notes:**
- The summary is generated by an AI model and can be refreshed to include the latest updates to the case.

**Related Feature Flags:**
- Works with `EngageActivityFeed`.

# `EngageRiderHub`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Eligibility Platform

**Description:** Enables the new Rider Hub, a centralized interface within Spare Engage designed for managing all aspects of an applicant's or rider's eligibility and case information. It provides a comprehensive 360-degree view of the individual.

**Why Enable:** The Rider Hub modernizes and streamlines the agent experience for managing eligibility. It consolidates information that might have been spread across different tabs or views into one unified interface, making it easier and faster for agents to find the information they need to make eligibility decisions.

**Pre-requisites:**
- The organization must be using Spare Engage.

**Notes:**
- This is a significant UI/UX upgrade for agents working in eligibility and case management.

**Related Feature Flags:**
- `HideRiderHubProfilePicture`: A sub-feature to control UI elements within the Rider Hub.

# `SensitiveDataField`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Eligibility Platform

**Description:** Introduces a "sensitive" property for custom fields in Spare Engage. When a field is marked as sensitive, its data will be masked or hidden from users who do not have the specific permission to view sensitive data.

**Why Enable:** Enhances data security and privacy by allowing organizations to control access to personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data collected in forms. This is critical for compliance with privacy regulations (like HIPAA) and for ensuring that only authorized personnel can view confidential applicant information.

**Pre-requisites:**
- Requires configuration of user roles and permissions to define who can view sensitive data.

**Notes:**
- This provides granular control over data visibility on a field-by-field basis.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `HideEmptyAppointmentLocation`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Eligibility Platform

**Description:** Hides the "Location" field on appointments within Spare Engage if no location has been set. It also makes the location field optional when creating an appointment.

**Why Enable:** Cleans up the UI by removing unnecessary empty fields, making the interface less cluttered. This is useful for organizations that have appointment types that do not require a physical location (e.g., a phone interview), improving the user experience for agents.

**Pre-requisites:**
- The organization must be using the appointments feature in Spare Engage.

**Notes:**
- A simple UI refinement to improve clarity and reduce visual noise.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `AllowIncompleteForms`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Eligibility Platform

**Description:** Allows admin users in Spare Engage to save a case form even if some required fields are not filled out.

**Why Enable:** Provides flexibility for agents in situations where they may not have all the required information at once. It allows them to save a partially completed form and return to it later, preventing data loss and allowing for a more iterative workflow. This is useful when waiting for an applicant to provide additional documentation or information.

**Pre-requisites:**
- The organization must be using forms within Spare Engage.

**Notes:**
- This feature should be used with caution, as it allows bypassing form validation. It is typically restricted to admin-level users.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `EdiEligibility`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Eligibility Platform

**Description:** Enables functionality for checking rider eligibility via an EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) integration with an external system.

**Why Enable:** For organizations that rely on an external system of record (e.g., a healthcare provider's database, a government agency's list) to determine trip eligibility. This flag allows Spare to connect to that external system to verify in real-time if a rider is eligible for a specific service, automating the eligibility verification process.

**Pre-requisites:**
- Requires a configured EDI integration with the external eligibility provider.

**Notes:**
- This is a highly specific integration feature and is only relevant for organizations that use EDI for eligibility.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `ConfigurableSummaryBar`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Eligibility Platform

**Description:** Adds the ability for users in Spare Engage to create and save custom filter views for the case summary bar. Users can define a set of filters (e.g., by case status, assignee) and save it as a named view for quick access.

**Why Enable:** Improves agent efficiency by allowing them to create personalized views of their caseload. An agent can create a view for "My Open Cases Due This Week" or "Unassigned Applications" and access it with a single click, instead of reapplying the same filters repeatedly.

**Pre-requisites:**
- The organization must be using Spare Engage.

**Notes:**
- These custom views appear alongside the built-in views like "All" and "To Do" in the summary bar.

**Related Feature Flags:**
Works independently of other flags.

# `HideRiderHubProfilePicture`

**Feature Flag Type:** Spare Eligibility Platform

**Description:** Hides the rider's profile picture within the Rider Hub interface in Spare Engage.

**Why Enable:** This is a UI configuration option for organizations that, for privacy reasons or policy, do not want to display profile pictures in the case management interface. It helps to reduce unconscious bias and comply with stricter data privacy policies.

**Pre-requisites:**
- `EngageRiderHub` must be enabled.

**Notes:**
- This flag only affects the Rider Hub interface.

**Related Feature Flags:**
- **Requires:** `EngageRiderHub`.
